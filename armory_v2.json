Although it is one of the more powerful shields available in-game, it is rare to see it used in combat as there are several similarly powerful shields which are cheaper or significantly easier to obtain.

It is held in the shield slot, and requires 30 rsrc28 and 30 rsrc30 to wield. It is recommended to keep the adamant defender as a backup in case a player were to lose their rsrc462 and having no other defenders would have to start back at bronze. Collecting more than one rune defender however solves this problem. If the player dies below level 20 rsrc464, it will remain in the player's inventory. However, the item will be unusable and must be repaired with 25,000 coins by using the item on rsrc465.  ",

When fully charged, it possesses defensive bonuses similar to those of a dragonfire shield.                         The ancient wyvern shield is created by using a rsrc1386 on the northern strange machine in the rsrc1235 while having a rsrc422 and an rsrc1387 in the inventory. The creation process requires level 66 in rsrc59 and rsrc74, granting the player 2,000 Magic and Smithing experience, but the player's Magic level will be completely drained to 0. When this occurs, a chatbox message will appear, stating At a great cost to your personal magical energies, you have crafted the wyvern visage and elemental shield into an ancient wyvern shield. The wyvern visage is dropped exclusively by rsrc15906 found in the rsrc1384, including the rsrc1397, rsrc1396, rsrc1393, and rsrc1385. However, rsrc410 do not  drop the wyvern visage; instead, it drops the rsrc1398. To charge the shield, players will need to use rsrc15907 or rsrc1281 on the shield, which are obtained from performing activities in rsrc1238. Players can right-click Recharge in the rsrc1390 tab to charge it, providing they have the required items in their inventory. Every charge increases its defence bonuses by +1, to a peak of a +50 Defence increase. However, its rsrc59 Defence will remain the same. Different types of fossils will give differing amounts of charges: During rsrc712, the ancient wyvern shield can be operated to expend one charge, unleashing a freeze blast attack (akin to those of rsrc1392) at a target, which can hit approximately 15 damage. This attack can only be used once every two minutes, and each expended charge reduces the shield's rsrc507 and rsrc78 defensive bonuses by one. Players do not have to use these attacks, as it does lower the shields defensive bonuses per attack. Players can drain all of the ancient wyvern shield's charges at once by right-clicking the shield in the inventory and selecting Empty. This will release all of the shield's charges in a harmless burst. This function is useful when selling or trading the shield, as it can only be traded when completely uncharged. In addition, if dropped on death in an unsafe environment, when recovered, the ancient wyvern shield will be completely uncharged.",

    "article-text": "The anti-dragon shield is an item obtained from rsrc1460 in rsrc1461 during the rsrc525 rsrc15898. After the quest, the shield can be purchased from rsrc1456. However, although the shield may be purchased by any player from the grand exchange, one must have at least started the Dragon Slayer quest to equip the shield. The anti-dragon shield mitigates the effects of rsrc1395, reducing the maximum hit of most dragon-breath attacks by >80%. It also prevents Elvarg from severely draining the player's combat stats. The effects of rsrc1457 stack with the anti-dragon shield; using both provides full protection from standard dragonfire attacks. The shield's defensive bonuses are roughly akin to those of an rsrc1458, though it also provides magical defence and has no attack penalties. This gives it some usefulness as an all-purpose shield.  Using a rsrc422 and rsrc438, players with 90 rsrc74 (can be rsrc15908) can attach a rsrc1398 to an anti-dragon shield to create a rsrc1394 Doing so grants 2,000 Smithing experience. Players without the required level can bring the components to rsrc1456, who will assist in creating the shield for a payment of 1,250,000 rsrc321. After rsrc230 is complete, a rsrc1462 can be fused with the anti-dragon shield in a similar fashion, creating a rsrc1455. Both of these shields inherit the anti-dragon shield's properties in addition to their own unique traits.  Originally, multiple shields could only be sourced from Duke Horacio by use of the rsrc1731.",

This process requires 90 rsrc81 and 85 rsrc74. Players without the required skill levels to create the shield may ask rsrc1579 in the rsrc1580 to combine the sigil and the blessed spirit shield, for a fee of 1,500,000 coins. This shield's defensive bonuses are identical to the rsrc1578, but it provides a magic attack bonus of +20. The arcane spirit shield's counterpart, the rsrc1581, instead provides a magic defence bonus of +30.  The shield has the same defensive bonuses as the blessed spirit shield, though it also gives a +20 Magic attack bonus. This makes it the best off-hand Magic attack item in the game, outclassing the rsrc1582 and the rsrc1383 (+15). The ancient wyvern shield offers more defence against stab, slash and magic attacks when fully charged, but penalizes ranged defence, unlike the arcane spirit shield. Like the other spirit shields, it also gives a small Prayer bonus and has no offensive penalties, making it suitable for all styles of combat. Its substantial Magic attack bonus, however, makes it most suited for mages.  The arcane spirit shield is the only sigil spirit shield that doesn't have a rsrc1673.",

This shield is a good choice for any player using rsrc507 because of its substantial defence bonuses and prayer bonus. Its crush defence bonus is also one point higher than that of a completely charged rsrc1394. Players who use rsrc59 or rsrc78 may also find this shield useful due to its lack of negative stats.   Originally, this item had a high alchemy value of 840,000 coins. Because this caused it to protect over rsrc15914, it was polled in Content Poll #27 whether it should be lowered, and passed by 77%.",

It can be considered similar to the rsrc15924 due to its substantial power and pricey repair costs. The crystal shield's melee defence bonuses are comparable to those of a rsrc4640. However, its ranged defence bonus is the highest of any one-handed shield. Once the crystal shield has reverted to a crystal seed, a player has the option of either buying a new crystal shield for the cost of 750,000 rsrc321 or having the seed converted back into a full shield or bow for a fee (See rsrc5010 below). Because it has to be repaired fairly often, and offers less melee protection than a rsrc1394, the crystal shield is generally used sparingly by players. However, it is still a more economical option in the short-term, especially when used in PvP scenarios. The crystal shield degrades over time. After 250 hits taken, it degrades into a \"Crystal shield 9/10\", and thereafter for every 250 hits taken, it will degrade another 1/10th, until it reverts into a rsrc4997 after a total of 2,500 hits, and must be recharged before it can be used again. As the shield degrades, the negative rsrc59 and rsrc78 attack bonuses remain the same while the positive bonuses decrease as shown below. The crystal shield can be imbued for 2,000 rsrc238 points per charge, requiring 20,000 points to imbue a fully charged shield. Imbuing the crystal shield does not keep it from degrading, however its stats will remain at their maximum, regardless of how much it has degraded. When the shield reverts back to a crystal seed, it will lose its imbue, and players must imbue it again using points from the Nightmare Zone. Additionally, imbuing a crystal shield that has already degraded to 9/10 or below will restore the shield's stats to their maximum. Taking non-combat damage splats also count against the shield's charges; for example, if you are rsrc15925 an NPC and happen to fail, it counts against your shield's charges. Because of this, a low-charge shield can quickly be reverted to a seed by attempting to eat rsrc236 continuously. rsrc4996 will recharge rsrc4997 into rsrc794 or crystal shields. She can be found teleporting back and forth between two clearings in rsrc2366. Initially, Ilfeen charges 750,000 coins to re-enchant a crystal seed into a crystal shield. However, the price is decreased by 150,000 coins each time Ilfeen re-enchants a seed for a player, in the following manner, until reaching the minimum recharge cost of 150,000 coins: The amount that Ilfeen charges is dependent on the number of crystal seeds she has re-enchanted, not the number of crystal shields she has recharged. For example, a player who pays Ilfeen 750,000 coins to re-enchant a crystal seed into a crystal bow will only have to pay her 600,000 coins to recharge a seed into a crystal shield. ",

It is used for its attack and strength bonus and is held in the shield slot. It requires level 60 rsrc30 to equip. It can only be obtained if the player has a combined rsrc28 and rsrc64 of 130, or level 99 in either rsrc28 or rsrc64. It is exclusively obtained as a rare drop in the basement of the rsrc50 from the rsrc372 that reside there. The entrance to the basement is outside, west of the building. A player must show a rsrc462 to rsrc5455 to access the cyclopes that drop the dragon defender. Its defensive bonuses are comparable to those of an rsrc651, with slight differences. Its strength bonus is surpassed by both the rsrc1394 and the rsrc1897, which give +7 and +8 strength bonus respectively. However, the dragon defender is more commonly used, due to its superior melee attack bonuses over the dragonfire shield, and the overall rarity of the avernic defender. If the player dies below level 20 rsrc464, it will remain in the player's inventory. However, the item will be unusable and must be repaired with 40,000 coins by using the item on rsrc465. If the player dies above level 20 Wilderness it will drop 8,160 gold (EVEN IF PROTECTED).  Players can attach a rsrc5454, obtained from rsrc15927, to cosmetically enhance the defender, creating a rsrc5456. This only alters its appearance, and gives no stat enhancements. It can be dismantled, returning the defender and ornament kit. Players can upgrade a dragon defender by attaching an rsrc1899 to it, creating the rsrc1897, which requires an rsrc28 and rsrc30 level of 70 and has increased bonuses. This process can be reversed, but the hilt will be destroyed in the process.  The dragon defender is the only defender which does not require a corresponding attack level to equip.",

    "article-text": "The dragon sq shield is the strongest rsrc658 in rsrc1469. It requires 60 rsrc30 to wield, along with completion of rsrc192. The dragon square shield is created by combining the rsrc5528, a very rare drop from a wide variety of monsters, and the rsrc5526, which must be purchased from rsrc4152 in the rsrc1542 for 750,000 rsrc321 or rsrc5527 on the top floor of the rsrc3068. The two shield halves are combined at any rsrc438 to produce the dragon square shield, a process that requires level 60 rsrc74 and awards 75 Smithing rsrc19. Smithing this shield in rsrc2248 is a task required in the hard set of the rsrc1624. A dragon sq shield can be combined with a rsrc5530 to make a gold-trimmed rsrc5529. This cosmetic enhancement won't change the stats in any way. After the completion of rsrc230, and with level 75 Smithing, the shield may be combined with a rsrc5437 and a rsrc5502 to create a rsrc5406.  ",

The ornament kit is only obtainable as a reward from elite clue scrolls, or from trading other users characters. Like its regular counterpart, the shield required 60 rsrc30 and completion of the rsrc192 to equip. It has the same stats as a regular Dragon sq shield, and serves no other purpose than making the Dragon sq shield look fancier. This shield along with the rest of the set are commonly thought of as gold-trimmed Dragon armour. Many players don't use this for fighting as it is more expensive than its regular counterpart and has the same stats. Rather, it is mostly used as a decoration in safe PvE or PvP situations.  ",

A rsrc30 level of at least 75 is required in order to wear it, as well as having started rsrc525. The shield offers two special characteristics: it acts like a regular rsrc1391 in terms of rsrc1395 protection, and it also protects against the icy breath of rsrc1392, similar to the rsrc1455, rsrc1387, rsrc1388 and rsrc1383. The dragonfire shield is an upgraded rsrc1391, and widely considered one of the best shields in the game, after the rsrc5539 and rsrc5354. A rsrc30 level of at least 75 is required in order to wear it, as well as having started rsrc525. The shield offers two special characteristics: it acts like a regular rsrc1391 in terms of rsrc1395 protection, and it also protects against the icy breath of rsrc1392, similar to the rsrc1455, rsrc1387, rsrc1388 and rsrc1383.                         The Dragonfire shield is unique in terms of rsrc30 it gives. When it's \"uncharged\", it is tradeable and offers slightly more defences than a rsrc2762. However, when fully charged, it is one of the best shields in the game. To charge the shield, you will need to absorb rsrc1395 attacks while wearing it. Every absorption effectively increases its defences by +1, to a peak of a +50 Defence increase. However, its rsrc59 Defence will remain the same. Although the Dragonfire shield is untradeable when charged, with the current death mechanics it will still be dropped on death if not protected. The dragonfire shield is created by attaching a rsrc1398 to an rsrc1391 at any rsrc438. The process requires 90 rsrc74 and a rsrc422, giving 2,000 Smithing experience and an uncharged dragonfire shield. Players who do not have the required Smithing level to make the shield can go to rsrc1456 in rsrc259, who will smith the shield for any player at a cost of 1,250,000 rsrc321. The draconic visage is dropped by most high-level dragons, including rsrc553, rsrc365, rsrc562, rsrc1285, rsrc15928, rsrc616 and rsrc363. However, rsrc474, rsrc708, rsrc605, rsrc458, rsrc360, and all rsrc5430 do not drop the draconic visage. As it absorbs the rsrc1395 attacks of adult dragons, the dragonfire shield builds charges. The shield can also be charged by absorbing the breath attacks of rsrc1392, although it will still discharge dragonfire. Each breath attack gives the shield one charge, and each charge increases its rsrc507 and rsrc78 defensive bonuses by +1. The shield can hold up to 50 charges, giving a total bonus of +50 to Melee and Ranged defences, in addition to the shield's base rsrc30 bonuses. The Check option, while the shield is in the inventory, can be used to check its current number of charges. When fully charged, the dragonfire shield surpasses most shields in the game for Melee and Ranged Defence, although the fully charged rsrc802 provides higher Ranged Defence. A quick and efficient way to charge an uncharged dragonfire shield is to be attacked by a rsrc5516 long-range dragonfire attack, which is not only quicker than a rsrc5538 attacks, but also will not include Melee attacks. Use of rsrc184 or an rsrc15929 potion is recommended due to the fact that 50 dragonfire attacks, even significantly weakened by the dragonfire shield, can build up and cause substantial damage. Food isn't necessary with an antifire potion. Additionally, there are two ways to charge a dragonfire shield in complete safety. The fastest way to recharge the dragonfire shield is by recharging it in the rsrc1323. If entered at the centre using the rsrc5540 spell (or Xeric's Heart teleport via rsrc1376), just run directly north to the rsrc365. You can let yourself be hit by the two iron dragons and the three rsrc458 there. It will take less than 1 minute to get 50 charges if none of the dragons are in melee range, but be sure to bring an antifire with you. During rsrc712, the dragonfire shield can expend one charge to unleash a blast of rsrc1395 at one target, which can hit approximately 25 damage. This attack can only be used once every two minutes, and each expended charge reduces the shield's rsrc507 and rsrc78 defensive bonuses by one. Note: you do not have to use these attacks, as it does lower the shields defensive bonuses per attack. The dragonfire attack follows the standard rules for dragonfire; it will be less effective against a target that has resistance to dragonfire, such as a player that used an rsrc1457 and/or an rsrc1391 or dragonfire shield. Furthermore, the dragonfire attack will not work against rsrc5538, rsrc1392 and some boss monsters, although rsrc5516 up to mithril are vulnerable to it. The dragonfire attack can be used at range (up to 10 squares away) and over obstacles, after which the user will initiate a normal attack with their equipped weapon, if possible. The damage splat is rolled with accordance to the user's rsrc30 level (and target's rsrc59 Defence bonus - change of being untrue). When used upon an rsrc15930, Magic, Defence and HP experience is gained; however, when used upon another player, only Defence experience is gained. Players can drain all of the dragonfire shield's charges at once by right-clicking the shield in the inventory and selecting Empty. This will release all of the shield's charges in a harmless burst. This function is useful when selling or trading the shield, as it can only be traded when completely uncharged. Also, if dropped on death in an unsafe environment, when recovered, the dragonfire shield will be completely uncharged.",

This process requires 90 rsrc81 and 85 rsrc74. Players without the required skill levels to create the shield may ask rsrc1579 in the rsrc1580 to combine the sigil and the blessed spirit shield, for a fee of 1,500,000 coins. This shield has superior rsrc507 and rsrc78 defence bonuses to the rsrc1389 and rsrc1581, as well as a very powerful rsrc1673.  The elysian spirit shield has a 70% chance of reducing the damage the player receives by 25%. This does not apply to non-combat damage e.g. rsrc296. The passive effect does stack with the rsrc5771 set effect. The passive effect makes this shield one of the strongest shields in RuneScape. On average, players wielding this shield will take 17.5% (0.25*0.70) less damage. Taking the damage reduction and probability for it to occur, a player with 99 rsrc65 would on average need to take 120 (99/0.825) damage to die. Note the passive effect ONLY applies to standard damage. Damage from monster rsrc1267 such as rsrc1395, rsrc5770 or rsrc5774 are unaffected. Healing effects such as the rsrc5772 effect or rsrc1127 are not reduced and will heal the full amount as if no damage was negated.  The original incarnation of the elysian spirit shield in RuneScape 2 did not feature a unique animation when the passive effect occurred. In classical Greek mythology, there is a realm in the Underworld called the rsrc15932, or the Elysian Plains. This is the final resting place for the souls of the heroic and the virtuous. However, this was only present in the Tartarus domain of the underworld. When rsrc5775 is killed during rsrc554, the player has the opportunity to retrieve her rsrc5773, however those who do soon find out that it has crumbled to dust and is useless.",

It has a has a slightly higher rsrc78 and rsrc15934 defence compared to the rsrc15935, but much lower rsrc15936 and rsrc15937 defence. It also lowers ranged attack and rsrc59 attack more than the rsrc15935. Therefore, it is not commonly used by players with 30 or higher Defence. It is, however, a safe alternative to players who have 25 Defence, as its defensive stats are comparably higher to those of the rsrc15938. This shield also greatly reduces the damage taken from the rsrc394' and thrower trolls' throwing rock attacks.  ",

    "article-text": "Kharedst's memoirs is a wieldable book that is used as a teleport item. It is a quest reward for the completion of the rsrc1503 rsrc15898. Players can reclaim the book, if lost, by speaking to rsrc4874 on the rsrc1419 docks. The book is a gift from the last king of the rsrc1584, King Kharedst IV, who ruled the Kingdom for forty years from the 135th to 139th decade, to his daughter Rose. The memoirs inside contain the outings Rose experienced with her father.  Upon obtaining it after the completion of rsrc1503, it has no use at all. To be able to use it, torn pages obtained from completing certain quests in rsrc1584 must be used on it. This allows the player to teleport to one of the five Houses of Great Kourend by using the Reminisce option on the memoir. Each teleport uses up one charge. Each torn page added onto the memoir will give it eight teleport charges, as well as increase the maximum number of charges available. Once at least one teleport charge is depleted, players can add more charges by inspecting the rsrc7387 north of rsrc2515, or west of the rsrc2571. To recharge the memoirs, players must have at least 1 rsrc1100, rsrc3183, rsrc830, and rsrc1132, costing 411 per charge. 10 Magic experience is granted for each charge added to the memoirs. The memoir can only be used to teleport to the rsrc2022 after completion of rsrc7007, the rsrc1419 after completion of rsrc7389 and the rsrc7386 after completion of rsrc5074. Because each teleport results in the player arriving near some flowers called \"lancalliums\", it is possible to determine the future teleport locations for the other Houses by finding the lancallium's locations within the three Houses. The memoirs have five missing pages, of which only the first three are currently obtainable. There are two additional pages, each for the other two houses of Kourend. As they are currently unobtainable (likely planned for future Kourend quests), it is not possible to add these pages to the memoir. There is a sixth rsrc7388 that can be found by using a rsrc556 on the memoir. Adding the secret page to the memoir does not increase the number of charges. A gift for Rose. If it pleases you, my dear child, would you record our future outings? When I'm old and my mind is fading I'd like to reminisce all the times we've spent together around this fine Kingdom of mine. Heed the lessons of our time together and reflect, for someday you will be Queen over this great land. ... Today Father and I had lunch by the River Hos, we sat on our favorite bench and watched as the farmers tended to their curious Bologano fruits. We were joined by a young farmer called Gric, he gave me a basket of strawberries and they're the best I've ever tasted! I recall he was writing a book and he and father discussed the mysteries of ageing for quite some time before he took leave and returned to his farm. The Lancalliums we'd planted previously were looking a little wilted but Father informed me that Gric would see to them and make sure that they wouldn't die. I asked if Gric could stop anything from dying, Father informed me that in the past a great wizard once beat death and this eventually lead to the residents of Arceuus being immortal, but they had to abandon most of what made them Human to do so. In the end, is it worth it? Forever is a long time and the mind is more fragile than you may realise. This happened a few weeks back, I've finally decided to write it down, perhaps it'll help. A favorite locale of ours is the Fisher's Market at the crossroads in Piscarilius, the merchants are lovely and the music is always enjoyable! The smell may not be for everyone, but after a while you'll forget about it. Being royalty, it's good practise to dress down and be somewhat anonymous as Father believes it's a good lesson in understanding the residents, for both the good traits and the bad. Today was a bad day. We were stood on the corner, listening to Rey play his golden flute (He always plays my requests and gives us fish when we leave, I'll miss his music.) and just as he had finished playing 'Mist on the River Hos' it happened. It was over quickly, a man stepped from the crowds and attempted to take the golden flute, Father instantly stepped between the two of them when suddenly a woman stepped forward with a knife. Blood was drawn, civilians screamed and the criminals ran. Father only sustained minor injury but The Fisher's Market is closed now and I believe Rey blames himself for all of it. I'm sure there is a lesson to be learnt from all of this but I'm currently yet to understand it. We left from the southern gate and travelled down the road which passed by the Mess. The usual discord echoed forth, merriment, humour and the clatter of cutlery. The southern door swung listlessly in the wind, further adding to the cacophony with a piercing creak. We turned off towards the west and headed over the stream, up the hill and towards the training grounds. Father slowed the Oxen to a steady pace as we passed by, but it was barren, bar 3 brutish men sparring silently in the combat ring. As we entered the graveyard, the wind blustered and suddenly I had to grip my coat in spite of the bitter conditions. I approached the grave cautiously, unsure of what I was expecting to happen, but whatever it may have been, it didn't. I quickly placed the Rose down and shuffled off down the path, Father prefers to speak with her by himself. I approached the old crypt and was surprised to see a strange man perched by the door. Noticing me, he smiled and greeted me, showing me a mouth full of blackened stumps. 'Morning love, what a day, 'ey?' he remarked. 'Foul,' I responded quietly. 'Pah! You know who's buried in this here tomb?' he pondered. 'I was told it's where we would bury our kings and queens, when there was space, anyway,' I spoke more to myself than the man, but he responded nonetheless. 'Aye! But d'you hear of the Wizard?' he asked. 'What Wizard?' I asked, failing to hide my curiosity. 'Been dead for a good while, so they say,' he smirked. 'Well, I've never heard of them,' I admitted. 'Do they no longer teach ye history? A high-born girl like you should be educated,' the man said as he wiped the sweat from his brow. His hands were far dirtier than I'd first noticed. 'Of course they do, I've even read Remoh's 'Tale of Darkness', the original manuscript,' I gloated, regretting instantly as it gave away my position far more than he had originally inferred. 'So yer 'ighness knows all about the Catacombs,' his eyes shone with a strange intensity. 'I do, but don't try to scare me with monsters, I know of the powerful magic that keeps them bound below,' I snapped, the conversation would likely displease Father if I continued any further. 'Below?' He laughed. 'The entrance below may be below the earth, but that realm lies beyond the reach of us mere mortals,' 'But Lustre was just a man and he entered without issue,' I countered. 'Other powers are at work, m'lady, powers far beyond the likes of us,' as he spoke, he eyed the crypt suspiciously, it looked as if he were about to say more when Father suddenly arrived. 'What nonsense are you bothering my child with, digger?' he demanded. The man struggled to his knees, submitting to his king, but his mouth kept that sardonic grin he enjoyed wearing. 'I beg your pardon, your highness! I was unaware of the girls stature,' he grovelled. 'Regardless, you should mind your tongue, spreading hearsay is a crime against the crown,' Father spoke with authority, one must if you expect your subjects to listen. 'Oh, I wouldn't dare stoop so low. It was but a folktale, your highness.' the man explained. 'Hmm, don't you have a job that needs attending?' Father questioned. 'That I do,' he responded while bowing far lower than necessary and he quickly hobbled away. 'What have I said about talking to strangers? Do you forget yourself, child?' Father scolded. 'I'm sorry Father, I wasn't expecting him to be here, I've always enjoyed visiting the old crypt,' I explained. 'Come along now, Rose, let's head back to the cart before the sun sets,'. ... This entry seems to be missing. ... This entry seems to be missing. If you're reading this, things haven't gone to plan and YOU should be worried. The King has been killed and I am 'Unfit for rule'... I have enough sanity left to know it won't be long until they come for me too. By all means, young stranger, attempt to rebuild this memoir, but I'm afraid you may not like the ending, I for one am not a fan. You may think you're ahead of the game, but the pieces have been in motion for decades and you are just another pawn, as was I. Perhaps we'll meet soon.

It offers the fourth best magic attack bonus for the off-hand slot in the game, succeeded by the rsrc1582, the rsrc1383 and the rsrc1389. In terms of stats, the ward provides rsrc507 defence identical to that of a rsrc15947 but provides a moderate amount of rsrc59 defence instead of providing ranged defence. The shield carries a substantial magic attack bonus but negative melee and ranged attack bonuses. Because of this the shield is ideal for mages, but unsuitable for other combat. Players can use a rsrc7802, obtained from the rsrc303, to cosmetically enhance the malediction ward, creating a rsrc7803. This only alters its appearance, and becomes untradeable. It can be reverted, but the kit will not be returned. The ward is created from three components: the rsrc7797, rsrc7798, and rsrc7801, dropped by the rsrc1357, rsrc1120, and rsrc741, respectively. When all three shards are present in the players inventory, they must travel to the rsrc15948 on the most north-eastern part of the rsrc464 to forge the ward.  ",

It is used for its attack bonus and is held in the off-hand in place of a shield. It requires 40 rsrc28 and 40 rsrc30 to wield. The rune defender is dropped by rsrc372 on the top floor of the rsrc50. To enter, a player must have a sum of at least 130 in Attack and Strength levels combined. Players may alternatively attain level 99 in one of these skills and will be granted entry. Strength potions or Attack potions cannot be used to reach the level requirement. Players must show either an rsrc461 or rune defender (player may obtain multiple Rune defenders if they want) to obtain this as a drop. The rsrc4309 does not affect the chances of getting it as a drop. The rune defender's slash and crush defensive bonuses are the same as a black kiteshield. However, its stab defence bonus is slightly less than an adamant square shield. It gives the same bonus to strength as the rsrc6636 (obsidian shield); however, it is much more commonly used due to its melee Attack bonuses. A rune defender is commonly combined with a rsrc639 or an rsrc252 for its strength bonus. The defender is popular among players of higher combat levels due to its offensive stats. It can be considered to be the third best off-hand item for melee training, only beaten by the rsrc250 and rsrc1897, and is commonly used in rsrc15952 situations. If the player dies below level 20 rsrc464, it will remain in the player's inventory. However, the item will be unusable and must be repaired with 35,000 coins by using the item on rsrc465. If the player dies above level 20 Wilderness they will drop 7,800 coins.  ",

Players with at least level 43 rsrc263 are also able to paint the rune kiteshield at a rsrc156 to create an untradeable rsrc6949, provided that they have visited rsrc517 to obtain a crest in advance. A painted rune kiteshield will not provide protection in the rsrc467, nor will it turn rsrc4207 hostile, if painted in the colours of rsrc1222 or rsrc1220.

    "article-text": "The spectral spirit shield is a shield which requires 75 rsrc30, 70 rsrc81 and 65 rsrc59 to wield. The shield is made by attaching a rsrc6977, a rare drop from the rsrc682, to a rsrc1578. This process requires 90 rsrc81 and 85 rsrc74. Players without the required skill levels to create the shield may ask rsrc1579 in the rsrc1580 to combine the sigil and the blessed spirit shield, for a fee of 1,500,000 coins. It has the highest Magic defence bonus of any shield in the game. This shield's melee and ranged defensive bonuses are identical to the rsrc1578, but it has a significantly higher magic defence bonus of +30. The spectral spirit shield's counterpart, the rsrc1389, instead provides a magic attack bonus of +20. The spectral spirit shield also has a unique rsrc1673.  The spectral spirit shield reduces the effectiveness of all rsrc81 draining attacks (outside of rsrc15952 encounters) by 50%. For example, rsrc5774 during the rsrc2681 fight will only drain 15 Prayer points when the shield is equipped instead of 30. This effect does not work against other players. When worn against rsrc9645, 50% of Prayer is drained on average.rsrc274 It is the spirit shield which most closely resembles its Runescape 2 appearance, its added handle being the only change in shape compared to its original model. On release, the spectral spirit shield did not have a passive effect, except against rsrc5774. This was expanded to all prayer draining attacks in rsrc15960 on 16 February rsrc125.",

The Spirit shield can be combined with a rsrc2960 to make a rsrc1578. The Blessed spirit shield can then be modified by attaching rsrc9669 to create the enhanced spirit shields.  There are three other enhanced versions of the shield: They all require 75 rsrc30 (the exception being the Blessed spirit shield which requires 70 Defence) and have rsrc59 and rsrc81 requirements depending on the type of sigil attached. The Arcane and Spectral spirit shields require only 70 rsrc81 and 65 rsrc59, while Elysian spirit shields require 75 rsrc81. The shield is slightly less powerful than a rsrc1260 in terms of slash, stab, and Ranged defence, but it surpasses even the rsrc4640 in crush defence, has no negative attack bonuses, and adds +1 rsrc81 and +1 rsrc59 defence. It is also recommended that rangers or mages use this shield as it is fairly strong and does not reduce your rsrc78 or rsrc59 rsrc28 bonuses. ",

The Zamorak unholy book provides the best all-around attack bonuses of the original three.

None of these have any effect on the game itself, and are simply recited lines of text. Lost unholy books can be reclaimed by speaking to rsrc1298, complete with all pages that have been added, for no cost. Alternatively, for those who do not wish to travel to the lighthouse, rsrc465 will return them to players for 12,000 rsrc321.

However, if a new quest comes out, the cape will automatically untrim itself, and cannot be equipped, operated, or trimmed until the player completes the new quest.

After that it can be upgraded to rsrc1814, for 75 mithril arrows and rsrc1876 or 4999 coins. Upon dying, if it is not an rsrc1877, it must be re-obtained from Ava for either an Ava's Attractor or 999 coins, in addition to 75 steel arrows. Multiple devices may be bought. The accumulator gives the second best Ranged attack bonus for the cape slot. The accumulator, like the attractor, can pick up a player's ammunition after they fire it. The accumulator also randomly attracts metal items (steel rsrc1685, rsrc1676 and rsrc556, rsrc1880, rsrc15975, rsrc1882 and rsrc1875) into the player's inventory. If the player's inventory is full, the attracted item will be dropped at their feet. The device will not pick up objects while you are wearing a metal rsrc1878 or rsrc98 with a negative Ranged attack bonus, as the metal armour interferes with the magnetic function of the accumulator. However, metal armour without a negative ranged attack bonus (such as rsrc1881), as well as rsrc626, rsrc15976, rsrc1879, rsrc15904, and rsrc358, will not interfere with Ava's accumulator. Note that rsrc115 will interfere with Ava's accumulator, despite it being mage armour. As of 20 February 2014, players can toggle the collection of random metal items by right-clicking the accumulator and selecting \"Commune\". The breakdown of the ammo recovery rate is as listed: Break on impact: 20% Drop onto floor: 8% Recovered automatically: 72%  ",

Due to the remaining 20% being the chance for ammunition to break, the assembler does not drop ammo on the ground. If the player dies below level 20 rsrc464, it will remain in their inventory.

    "article-text": "Capes of Accomplishment (more commonly known as a Skillcape among players) is a cape that symbolises achieving the highest possible level in a particular rsrc15940 (level 99), the completion of every rsrc15898 (266 QP), every rsrc332, or unlocking all the in-game rsrc8162. Capes of Accomplishment are rsrc17' only items. Capes of Accomplishment cost 99,000 rsrc321 (same price for the trimmed capes once you have trained two or more skills to 99). Each are obtainable from specific rsrc15930 masters, who can be seen proudly displaying the cape. A temporary skill boost that raises a skill level to 99 will not allow the player to obtain the corresponding cape. The NPC is located in a place related to his/her skill. Capes also come with matching hoods, although the hoods do not offer any bonuses. When a player achieves a second level 99 skill, their earlier cape of accomplishment receives a graphical enhancement in the form of a \"trim\" of a different colour. This trim is irreversible. These so called \"trimmed skillcapes\" can be used to show that someone has more than one skillcape. The rsrc325 will allow you to trim both the rsrc6000 and the rsrc8156, although the achievement diary cape can only be trimmed after obtaining the quest point cape. Unlike other Capes of Accomplishment, the aforementioned three capes can be manually trimmed and untrimmed by use of the right click menu. As of 1 September 2018, rsrc866 is the least common skillcape with 8,538 players having 99 Runecrafting; however, the number of players with the quest point cape, achievement diary cape, and music cape is unknown. As of 6 February 2017, the top five least common skillcapes are Runecrafting, rsrc289, rsrc21, rsrc74, and rsrc505, respectively, while the five most common skillcapes are rsrc64, rsrc65, rsrc745, rsrc78, and rsrc28, respectively. This is a general reflection of the usefulness of the skill, and the difficulty it takes to train the pertaining skill. If a player kills another for their skillcape, 11,800 coins will appear on the floor for the killer. All of the different Capes of Accomplishment provide the same bonuses, with the exception of untrimmed and trimmed skillcapes, where the trimmed versions and the rsrc312 provide a +4 prayer bonus. Untrimmed Capes of Accomplishment have identical stats to that of an rsrc2099.  Each cape has certain benefits. For example, the rsrc6111 will act as a rsrc15946 when equipped, and wearing the rsrc1418 will prevent any food from being burned. A rsrc312 will provide all the perks of all skillcapes. However, a max cape may be combined with certain best-in-slot cape slot items, such as the rsrc5262, creating a rsrc6838. Doing so will cause the max cape to assume the stats of the item it was combined with, forfeiting the max cape perks, making it merely a cosmetic enhancement to the original item. A list of all possible max cape combinations can be found rsrc13091. If a player displays a certain set of skillcapes on the rsrc4280 in a rsrc156 rsrc1332, the rsrc15986 that they have will become available only to the house owner. The perks of the following skillcapes can be used while displayed on the cape hanger: Wearing the cape and selecting the \"Boost\" option in the equipment menu temporarily boosts the player's effective level in the cape's skill by one, up to 100. This does not apply to the rsrc6000. The rsrc6964 and rsrc8680 have a one-minute cool-down period between uses of this effect. The boost effect follows the same rules as any other skill boost, lasting up to 60 seconds if no other boosts are active at the time of boosting. Every cape's boost cannot be reactivated until the skill has dropped back to 99. When you equip the cape, the boost automatically activates. The following skills have no uses from the skill boost unless their level is temporarily decreased: rsrc289, rsrc771, rsrc263, rsrc316, rsrc285, rsrc66 and rsrc352.  If a player somehow possesses a cape of accomplishment for a skill that they later have the base level reduced, they will be unable to wear it until they achieve 99 again. The max cape does not have an operate function, and thus cannot boost any skill."

There are various NPCs who appear to be wearing the cape or some variation thereof. Its stats are comparable to an rsrc2099, which has +2 more defence bonuses. However, it should be noted that the cape of legends is far cheaper than the obsidian cape. As a result, it is a popular choice for a cape when rsrc15987 or taking part in dangerous activities. The cape may be mounted in the rsrc1096 of a rsrc156 in the Guild trophy space. This requires 3 rsrc1088 and grants 300 rsrc289 experience.

As of 1 September 2018, there are 21,873 current members that have achieved rsrc766 in Farming.  ",

It is the second-to-best rsrc15997 in the game after the rsrc5318, due to its +4 rsrc305 as well as its +11 defensive stats. Fire capes can be stored on the rsrc344 in a rsrc15998 of a rsrc156. Players who don't want their cape can sell it to rsrc6109 for 8,000 rsrc703; alternatively, players may exchange their fire capes for a chance of obtaining the rsrc6110 pet. A lost fire cape can only be replaced by defeating TzTok-Jad again to receive another one. A fire cape must be shown to rsrc5938 guards around the center of the city to allow further access to rsrc6114. This does not consume the fire cape. However, to enter the rsrc6113, a fire cape must be sacrificed by giving it to rsrc6108. This is a one-time fee. Upon death in the rsrc464 (level 20 and above in the Wilderness), if you do not protect this item, it will be converted into coins when dropped. If the player dies below level 20 Wilderness, it will remain in the player's inventory. However, the item will be unusable and must be repaired by using it on rsrc465 and paying him 50,000 coins.   Using an item on the fire cape results in a game message stating \"That doesn't seem to do what you want it to.\" instead of the usual \"Nothing interesting happens.\" message. The first rsrc15930 to wear this cape was the rsrc1956, rsrc5775. The fire cape, rsrc6112, rsrc5318 and rsrc7086 are the only capes to have an animated texture whilst wearing it.",

When the cape is created, the rsrc310 that is required to be in the player's inventory during the cape's creation is automatically converted to the rsrc6118. Like the other max cape variants (a max cape combined with another rsrc15967 item), the fire max cape does not have the max cape's stats or perks; it only acts as a cosmetic upgrade to the fire cape. However, the cape can still be used to perform the rsrc309. rsrc311 is able to refund a max cape, along with its variants, for 1,821,600 coins each, as long as the player has both the hood and cape in their inventory. It is important to note that capes combined with the max cape will be lost upon refund and will need to be earned again. Upon death in the wilderness (level 20 and above in the rsrc464) if you do not protect this item, it will be converted into coins when dropped. If the player dies below level 20 Wilderness, it will remain in the player's inventory. However, the item will be unusable and must be repaired with 50,000 coins by using the item on rsrc465.  Unlike the fire cape, the fire max cape's lava textures are not animated when dropped. The fire max cape originally had a plain colour scheme of yellow, red and black. It was rsrc14782 on January 26, 2017 to include the lava texturersrc274, and revised a week later to make it brighter and to animate the lava flowrsrc2761.",

    "article-text": "The Herblore cape, otherwise known as the Skillcape of Herblore, is a rsrc1849 that may only be acquired and worn by players who have achieved the maximum level in the rsrc771 skill, 99. Once players have trained to this level, they may purchase the cape from rsrc6955 the druid, located in the druid circle of rsrc368 - slightly north of the eastern end of the Witch's House - for which a fee of 99,000 coins is charged. When this fee is paid, the player receives both the cape and the matching hood. Herblore capes are a dark green colour, and have a yellow-gold trim for players who have more than one 99. Like all skillcapes, the herblore cape gives +9 to all defensive stats, and also a +4 bonus to prayer if it is trimmed, which requires a second skill of 99. The cape is automatically trimmed if this condition is met. When the Herblore cape is equipped, players can search it to obtain a rsrc197. In addition, players can use rsrc16007 to create rsrc5283; doing so gives the experience of cleaning the herb. If players have not completed the hard rsrc5281, rsrc777 in rsrc1183 will now create unfinished potions for 200 coins each. As of 1 September 2018, there are 13,461 current members that have achieved rsrc766 in Herblore.  ",

However, the item will become unusable and must be repaired with 50,000 coins by using the item on rsrc465. Given the requirements of obtaining a max cape, along with the difficulty of completing the rsrc6113, the infernal max cape is one of the hardest items to obtain in Old School Runescape, requiring great time commitment, resources, and ability.

    "article-text": "The max cape is a cape available to players who have attained level 99 in all 23 rsrc58. It is sold by rsrc311 for 2,277,000 coins. rsrc311 is located on an island west of the rsrc50, beyond the ladder that leads to rsrc372. To reach him, the player needs a pickaxe and an axe. The minimum total level a player needs for the max cape is 2,277, the minimum amount of rsrc19 required being 299,791,913. When purchased, it comes along with a corresponding rsrc310. Its stats are equivalent to a rsrc1849. It inherits all the rsrc16011 from other skillcapes. rsrc311 will purchase excess max capes for 1,821,600 coins. This can only be done if the player has both the hood and cape in their inventory. Other max cape variants can be refunded in the same manner. As of 1 September 2018, there are 4,237 current members that have achieved rsrc766 in all skills. The max cape's emote shows all 23 skills flying above the character's head, and a bar graph stylised like the rsrc7862 interface icon, with the player floating over it.  Due to game engine limitations, the max cape's colours cannot be changed freely like in rsrc16012. However, there are several variants of the max cape that are of different colours than the default appearance. Players can use the max cape on certain best-in-slot cape items, which will change the stats of the max cape to those of the item being combined. This requires both the max cape and max hood in their inventory. When combined, the max cape will lose its perks, making it merely a cosmetic enhancement to the original item. Any max cape variants sold back to Mac will only return the max cape and hood; the other item used to create the max cape variant will not be returned. The items that can be combined are as follows:  When a player buys a max cape, the rsrc3109, rsrc11743, the rsrc13188, and rsrc16013 will congratulate the player via magic: Wise Old Man: Hello? Player: Huh, who's there? Wise Old Man: It's Dionysius here. I'm using my magic to communicate to you. Don't worry. Player: What are you doing in my head? Wise Old Man: I just wanted to say congratulations <player name>. I've been watching you in your adventures - very well done. Hans: Oh very well done <player name>. Taken you a while, but I knew you could do it. RuneScape Guide: Ahhh <player name>, I knew you had potential when I first met you. My compliments on reaching the pinnacle of your achievements. (If rsrc230 has not been completed): rsrc16013: Meow! (Alternatively, if the player is wearing a rsrc4224): rsrc16013: Oh most excellently done old chap! Wise Old Man: Hello? Player: Huh, who's there? Wise Old Man: It's Dionysius here. I'm using my magic to communicate to you. Don't worry. Player: What are you doing in my head?

    "article-text": "The Quest point cape (often referred to as \"Quest Cape\", \"QC\" or \"QPC\") can be obtained by players who have completed all rsrc132 and achieved 266 rsrc8788. The cape, along with the rsrc8787, can be purchased from the rsrc3109 in rsrc340 for 99,000 rsrc321. The cape can teleport players to the rsrc1542 gates for an unlimited amount of times. This is especially convenient as it teleports players close to a rsrc16021. Also, players with the maximum number of quest points will find that the prices of dreams in the rsrc238 are reduced by 10000 coins. The untrimmed version of the cape is generally thought to be an achievement that is on par with levelling a skill to 99, while the trimmed quest point cape requires much more effort. To trim the cape, a player must complete all rsrc15968 thus earning them the rsrc16022 as well. Should a new quest come out, the cape will be unequipped and the player wearing it cannot equip it until the new quest is completed. If the player's inventory is full the cape will be banked instead. In the event that your inventory and bank are both full, you will have to re-purchase the cape and hood from the Wise Old Man! Until the new quest is completed, the cape's teleport cannot be used either.  The minimum levels required to acquire the quest point cape are: - indicates that it is actually impossible to get the Quest Point Cape with the aforementioned total level because the player needs a combat level of 85 to complete the rsrc1829 quest. The combat stats above only get a player to a combat level of 71. rsrc6909 may need higher levels in some skills due to item requirements. For example, 75 woodcutting or 58 hunter (rsrc1895) can be used to obtain rsrc1756 for rsrc1336 and rsrc2239. Another example is if players burn the rsrc3972 in rsrc509, you need 65 fishing to be able to fish them yourself. The absolute minimum total level (with maximum boosts and 85 combat) required to complete all quests is 1311. The quests requiring the highest skill levels, along with the levels required (some without boosts) are: The Quest Point Cape (t) requires completion of all rsrc332, which significantly increases the minimum requirements from those of the regular untrimmed version.

To receive the cape, the player must defeat rsrc5255 in his four guises, then speak to him, step through the nearby sparkling pool, and finally pray at the statue of rsrc1220. Upon praying at the statue, the Zamorak cape will appear next to the player and can be picked up. The Zamorak cape and the rsrc10452 are required to benefit from the rsrc858 spell, which enables the player to hit up to 50% more damage with the rsrc837 spell. Once lost, a player can get a new cape by once again praying at the statue of Zamorak. Kolodion does not have to be fought again. Alternatively, players can purchase one from rsrc465 for 23,000 coins (although this requires the player obtain the cape at least once from the Mage Arena). ",

When worn, the bracelet provides a 25% chance for the kill to count as two kills toward the player's rsrc3482 (but does not grant additional experience). That is, on average, the bracelet activates every four monster deaths to provide the player 5 kills towards their assignment. Thus, the bracelet can be used to speed up slayer tasks the player does not particularly like doing. Note that the bracelet needs to be worn only at the moment you defeat your opponent for the effect to occur. This means that for the rest of the fight, other bracelets or gloves can be worn such as the rsrc2259. The bracelet has 30 charges, with one charge used each time it activates, and will disappear when all its charges are used. The number of charges is linked to the player. The only way to reset the charges is by breaking a bracelet, via right-clicking it. You need an average of 1 charge per 5 assigned Slayer creatures or a bracelet for every 150 kills, so, to calculate how many bracelets to take on your Slayer trip, divide the total you need to kill by 5 and make sure you have at least that many charges with you.

To wear the gloves of silence, players need at least level 54 Hunter. They reduce your chance of failure while rsrc16050 by 5%. They eventually break after 62 failed pickpockets.

Repairing the gloves does not grant Crafting experience points to the player. These gloves will not degrade if thieving in rsrc23 or rsrc3096 if the medium or hard rsrc1624 are completed respectively. This is due to the fact that the effect the cloak provides (10%) is higher than that of the gloves and does not stack; therefore, these gloves become completely obsolete after the hard Ardougne diary is completedrsrc274. It is important to note that the effect the rsrc6485 provide towards thieving success is always active; in other words, the cloak does not need to be worn for the effect to take place.  ",

The gold bracelet has no stats and cannot be enchanted, making it purely cosmetic. If a player has any cut gems along with the gold bar and mould, they could instead make a gem bracelet (such as a cut rsrc1111 with a gold bar making a rsrc3476). It is commonly used as a High Alchemy item because it is very cheap and very easy to make, with little to no loss of revenue. Due to the high price of gold ore it is advised that the player buys gold bars rather than smelting their own from ores.  ",

The effect of the regen bracelet will stack with either the rsrc233 rsrc81 or with the rsrc6964 (which do not stack with each other). Using either of these in conjunction with a regen bracelet will quadruple the rate of HP regeneration. This is a very helpful perk for people who are fighting NPCs that deal low amounts of damage, allowing wearers to bank less and rely on fewer outside sources of healing. Originally the bracelet had no stats; this was changed in an rsrc16065 on 1 May 2014. It now surpasses the rsrc485 and rsrc4792 as the best-in-slot melee item for 1 rsrc30 pures.  ",

This effect stacks with other boosts. Wearing any piece of enchanted rsrc1138 equipment requires level 75 in rsrc65. Players can make one by enchanting a rsrc10066 with the rsrc1135 spell. This requires level 93 rsrc59, 20 rsrc1132, 20 rsrc1137, and 1 rsrc1136 and grants 110 Magic experience.  In the original Developer's Blog, it was proposed that zenyte jewellery, in addition to its stats, would provide a passive healing effect provided that it was charged with a cut rsrc2819rsrc274. Charged zenyte jewellery equipped would have a 10% chance of healing 5% of the damage dealt to a target. This effect would last for 10,000 successful hits, which when depleted would return the zenyte jewellery to its uncharged state and would require another onyx to become charged again. This was polled in the Old School Content Poll #39, where it only received 69.1% votes in favour, 5.9% short of passing the poll.",

The P in 'perfect' ring is not capitalised because all items in RuneScape use ucfirst capitalisation, wherein the first letter of a string is capitalised, but the rest is not.",

A full ring of dueling will provide 8 teleports before it crumbles away into nothing. Due to the low cost of the ring, many players use it to bank quickly at the rsrc430 chest. Furthermore, the rsrc5868 teleport allows a player to enter and leave the Clan Wars portal whilst gaining full health, prayer and run energy, although the Clan Wars teleport places the player slightly further away from a bank chest. When a ring of dueling has one charge remaining, it is recommended not to use the last charge, but instead to save it and cast rsrc8 on it later, as it has the same value as a fully charged ring. Each charge costs 128.88 rsrc321 if all 8 charges are used, 73 if using High Level Alchemy (as mentioned above), or 109.43 if using rsrc4. Alternatively, rsrc5997 can be used 30 times per day for a cost of 74.43. This is viable if fewer than 210 charges are used on average each day, though it gives no Magic experience.   Despite RuneScape following British English variations of spelling, ring of dueling uses the American spelling as opposed to \"duelling\".",

    "article-text": "A ring of recoil is a ring made by a rsrc2593 used with rsrc1023. If worn, 10% of the damage received by the player will be received by the attacker, this will apply on monsters and other players. The damage is always rounded up to the nearest point if the damage is fractional, so it will always deal at least 1 damage when you are hit. The ring does not last forever, as it will deal up to 40 hitpoints of damage before it shatters. To check the damage points left in the ring, it must be equipped, and you can operate it in the Worn Equipment interface. The amount of damage a ring can deal is recorded for each character, not each ring. This means that a newly equipped ring will have the same amount of charges remaining as any other ring, instead of the full 40. To get a ring to have 40 charges, fully use a ring until it shatters or right click and break it when it is not equipped. The next ring equipped will have 40 charges. Many players, especially rsrc3358, use this ring as they find it useful on quests and other combat-involved activities. In fact, the ring of recoil will usually result in more damage than the much more expensive rsrc2461, especially with lower strength and defence levels. The ring of recoil is especially useful against opponents with high attack speeds and low damage. When under attack from multiple opponents, the ring will recoil any damage taken to a random attacker. As a result, it is possible for one attacker to receive multiple hits of recoil damage at the same time. However, as of 2 July 2015, recoil damage will now always target the NPC that caused the initial damage, rather than the most recent NPC who dealt damage. Players who wear a ring of recoil, rsrc5311, an rsrc800, and have rsrc1128 activated may rebound 100% of damage taken from a hit onto their opponent. Such a case may prove itself extremely effective in rsrc15952 situations.  ",

Charges are not lost upon death.   In the original Developer's Blog, it was proposed that zenyte jewellery, in addition to its stats, would provide a passive healing effect provided that it was charged with a cut rsrc2819rsrc274. Charged zenyte jewellery equipped would have a 10% chance of healing 5% of the damage dealt to a target. This effect would last for 10,000 successful hits, which when depleted would return the zenyte jewellery to its uncharged state and would require another onyx to become charged again.

    "article-text": "Charged Uncharged                                                 The ring of wealth is an enchanted ring that removes 32 of the empty slots from the rsrc16088. It should be noted that the ring only needs to be worn by the player while dealing the killing blow before the loot appears, and does not have to be worn during the entire battle. It will also automatically collect rsrc321, rsrc703 and rsrc1281 drops from monsters that the player kills; this can be toggled by right-clicking the ring. The ring's effect only occurs when the rare drop table is rolled; it has no effect on the likelihood of rolling the rare drop table and thus does not affect any other item drop rates outside of the Mega-Rare sub-table. rsrc6909 who desire the items in the Mega-Rare sub-table may opt to wear a ring of wealth when defeating monsters, especially if they roll the rare drop table often, as they are significantly more likely to receive these items while the ring is worn. It is especially recommended to wear one before obtaining any combat rings, such as rsrc2461. The ring can be made by casting the spell rsrc1103 on a rsrc5546, requiring level 68 rsrc59 and giving 78 experience. You can make a dragonstone ring at 55 rsrc263 by combining a cut rsrc5476 and a rsrc3 at a furnace using a rsrc5338. As of 24 July 2014, the ring of wealth has a right-click option to bring up a log recording various bosses player kills. Once a player reaches 65,535 kills the log will say \"Lots!\" for that particular boss. This is because the kill count is saved into an unsigned rsrc16089 integer variable that has a maximum value of 65,535. Players can rsrc4484 using a rsrc8972, purchased from the rsrc303, to enhance the ring's capabilities. An imbued ring will double the chance of obtaining a rsrc403 from monsters as well as from skilling while in the rsrc464. The ring also increases the amount of rsrc412 dropped by the rsrc3782.  The ring, like all other dragonstone jewellery, is useful when travelling in the rsrc464, as it will work up to level 30 Wilderness, while most other means of teleportation will not work above level 20 Wilderness. Players can access the teleports by either rubbing it in their inventory and selecting their destination from the option box which appears, or they can right click it when equipped and select one of their destinations. The ring can only be charged at the rsrc1072; not even a rsrc1098 will work for this. Charging it at the Fountain of Rune gives it five charges to teleport to the following locations: Initially, rsrc1741 believed on a 'RuneScape Mythbusters Special' that \"wearing the ring of wealth, when completing a clue scroll, will give you a better chance of landing on a rare drop table\".rsrc274 It was later confirmed twice on twitter that the ring of wealth does not improve the chances of loot from rsrc403. rsrc2761rsrc5332 The ability to automatically pick up coin drops was introduced in the rsrc16090 update on August 18, 2016.",

It is very useful when using rsrc5634 as the tyrannical ring is the only ring that provides a crush attack bonus.

It is often used with rsrc2134 for its rsrc15915, as it only reduces the enemy's defence if the player hits, which is where the tyrannical ring's accuracy bonus helps. It can be imbued into a rsrc10136 using 650,000 rsrc238 reward points, giving it a +8 crush attack and defence bonus, instead of the usual +4.   On release, the ring was weightless. This was changed in an update. The tyrannical ring is one of three rings that weigh more than 0 kg, the others being its rsrc10136 and rsrc6633.",

    "article-text": "Charged: A dragonstone amulet with X magic charges. The amulet of glory is a rsrc1071 enchanted by the rsrc59 spell rsrc1103. It requires 80 rsrc263 for a player to craft themselves. It is a very popular amulet in rsrc17 worlds amongst players of all levels, as it provides good damage bonuses, has no requirements to wear, is much less expensive than the rsrc1075, and offers useful rsrc16098. A trimmed version, the rsrc1067, may be obtained from hard rsrc82, but is no different than a normal amulet of glory aside from appearance. The amulet of glory can be obtained either through crafting and enchanting or dropped by rsrc1092.  Players can access the teleports by either right-clicking the amulet in their inventory and selecting \"rub\", or right-clicking it while equipped and selecting one of their destinations. The amulet has a maximum of 4 charges when charged in the rsrc1090 and 6 charges when charged at the rsrc1072. Each teleport consumes one of the amulet's charges. Teleports are available to the following four locations: The teleport locations allow access to other transportation grids. From Edgeville, players may use the rsrc1097 system to travel up and down rsrc1104, the rsrc16021 system (one is located east of Edgeville), and the rsrc490 via an underwall tunnel (level 21 rsrc505 required), which itself grants access to the rsrc1091 network and the rsrc16099. Karamja teleport puts the player close to the rsrc1093 system. Draynor Village is close to rsrc405 for transportation for boats. rsrc625 teleport is near the rsrc1089, allowing access to the rsrc1094 and the rsrc1087 system, and the rsrc1101 to the north. The amulet of glory is useful when travelling in the rsrc464, as teleports from dragonstone jewellery will work up to level 30 Wilderness, while most other means of teleportation will not work above level 20 Wilderness. After at least one charge has been used, an amulet of glory can be recharged by using it on the rsrc1105 below the rsrc1090, which requires the completion of rsrc1102 to access. Doing so will fully charge all the amulets in the player's inventory to 4 charges. Players can also use a rsrc1098 or cast the rsrc1095 rsrc16100 (with 89 rsrc59 and completion of the Fremennik Hard Diary) to restore all amulets in their inventory to 4 charges. Alternatively, players can charge the amulet at the rsrc1072 (this also requires completion of Heroes' Quest to use), which is located east of the rsrc1070 in the rsrc464. Charging an Amulet of glory at the Fountain of Rune grants 6 charges instead of the usual 4. When a player is charging Amulets of glory at the Fountain of Rune, there is a 1 in 25,000 chance that an amulet of glory will turn into an rsrc1065, which provides unlimited teleport charges. When this occurs, a message in the chatbox will appear, stating The power of the fountain is transferred into an amulet of eternal glory. It will now have unlimited charges. If the Amulet of glory has any charges, wearing it while rsrc21 will increase the chances of finding rsrc16101 (from 1/256 to 1/86). It will also significantly increase the speed of mining rsrc16102. At level 47 rsrc289 (boosts such as the rsrc1099 work), the amulet of glory can be mounted in a rsrc156, within the rsrc1096. This requires an uncharged amulet of glory and three rsrc1088. While mounted, this amulet provides unlimited teleport charges. Mounting the Amulet of glory does not require the completion of rsrc1102. Amulets of glory are very useful for rsrc866 through the rsrc257, granting a fast way to return to rsrc259. They can also be used for Runecrafting rsrc1100 by taking the boat to rsrc1106, then teleporting to rsrc340 to bank the runes. ",

The amulet has the same bonuses as an rsrc266. Like rsrc807, it can only be traded when it hasn't been used. It will degrade at the same rate as any other barrows armour, but once it fully degrades, it will turn to dust. It becomes untradeable once it degrades. Players with multiple amulets can combine charges. Despite being untradeable (once degraded) it isn't kept automatically on death in a \"safe\" location. Should you die with the amulet, the amulet will turn to dust, making it impossible to recover. It is also involved in a combat related clue where it may degrade. The following buffs are granted if a player wears a full Barrows armour set in conjunction with the amulet of the damned. These buffs can trigger at the same time as the armour's set effects.   The amulet was originally polled as a drop from rsrc381 in the Old School feature poll #9: God Wars & Banks, where it would absorb a fraction of combat damage from any hitsplat over 15 hitpoints when worn with a full set of rsrc807. It gained 61.9% yes votes, 13.1% short of the passing threshold required. The introduction of the amulet was re-polled as a reward from the rsrc1131 in Old School Content Poll #26, and passed with 75%. Interestingly enough, although the amulet seems to be a piece of Barrows equipment, it does not require a rsrc30 level to wear. However, using the amulet without a barrows set is counter productive, since it can simply be substituted for an rsrc266 which will not degrade. The amulet is similar to RuneScape 3's rsrc16107, albeit giving different set effect buffs.",

    "article-text": "The Armadyl pendant is obtained during the rsrc1729 quest if the player decides to side with the rsrc16108. After the quest it can be retrieved by talking to them. Players who sided with rsrc1732 can obtain it by killing the Guardians after the quest. Players can obtain multiple pendants easily by performing the rsrc1731. This pendant is by far the most easily obtainable protection against followers of rsrc1664 in the rsrc467. It is also probably the most popular protection for Armadyl because of its low price and ease of obtaining. To reach the Guardians of Armadyl after the quest, players can use a rsrc1728 to unlock the door to the shed on the northern edge of rsrc1725, climb down the ladder to the rsrc1730, and then run west to the Guardian's headquarters. If players do not have one, they must proceed through the dungeon starting from its entrance north of rsrc23. In order to access the dungeon, players must be wearing the rsrc1727, which Lucien will provide freely. Once entering the dungeon players must take the north gate then proceed out the northern exit of the first room. Ignoring the small room with the lever, they must then run west to the site where they fought the rsrc1733, who will not appear again. Players then talk to rsrc1726, who will teleport the player across the lava, this time without asking for any rsrc1491. Players then run north until they reach a ladder (which leads up to McGrubor's Wood), then west, where they will reach the Guardian's headquarters. It is recommended that players run further west, then south past the rsrc1325, to pick up a Shiny key, which will make future trips much faster.   The rsrc1727 and the Armadyl pendant look almost identical; however, the Pendant of lucien's middle gem is green for males, whereas the Armadyl pendant's gem is silver on males. For females, both pendants have an identical red gem. Before the release of the rsrc467, when Armadyl pendants were useless, players who did not help the Guardians could not get a pendant. When the God Wars Dungeon was released, rsrc2868 added Armadyl pendants to the Guardian drop list, so players who did not help them could still make use of it. The pendant has only one purpose, to serve at God Wars Dungeon as a protection against Armadyl's forces. It has no bonuses, so in any other way the pendant is useless. The amulet's previous examine text was joking at the fact that you receive the Pendant of lucien at the beginning of the quest, and then you receive another pendant later on (if you sided with the Armadyl Guardians).",

This item has no effect when worn, and is only for show. If players lose or drop their training medal, they may talk to Gertrude to get another one. The cat must catch the rats before it turns into an overgrown cat, which cannot hunt vermin. Players who only have these must buy another kitten from Gertrude, or those who have done the rsrc3329 rsrc132 can train their cat into a rsrc3763 one. Note that training overgrown cats in to wily cat resets the rat kill counter to zero. One of the best places to catch rats is in rsrc2248. On the west side of the city, players can enter a small house containing an rsrc438, where there should be two rats inside. The most effective strategy is to close the door, trapping the rats inside. The rats rsrc3840 very quickly and are confined to a small place, so there is a higher and faster chance of successful catches. Alternative places to hunt rats include the rsrc4155 hideout, rsrc4220, rsrc1461, and rsrc3766's basement where Hell-Rats may be caught to obtain spices for making rsrc3764. Kittens have a low chance of catching rats, so it is recommended to wait until your kitten has grown into a cat before you try to catch rats. Additionally, a wily cat will not count if you already have a normal cat!  rsrc7301 and rsrc7704, residents of rsrc2469, appear to be wearing these medals. Even though the picture of the amulet is coloured grey, when worn, the tail is blue. When killing rsrc4222 to get a medal, your character will congratulate your cat after 10, 50, and 100 kills, meaning you won't need to keep track of your kills. At 100, the player says, \"incredible puss! That's 100 rodents caught!\" The amulet itself resembles a rsrc3953.",

To do so, right click the amulet, use the \"Open\" option which will open a compass-like interface in the shape of a cat, and turn the compass clockwise or anti-clockwise by clicking on the whiskers until the eyes are lit and the cat's mouth starts moving. After the events of rsrc230, opening the amulet simply results in the message, \"You look at the amulet and take a moment to remember your fallen friend.\" If the amulet is lost, you will have to visit the rsrc4225 in rsrc450 if you don't have a spare regular amulet (bring a cat), and pay Hild another 5 death runes and your catspeak amulet to get it enchanted again. Unlike the regular amulet, you can only hold one enchanted catspeak amulet at any time.  ",

Unlike most gold jewellery, this necklace cannot be enchanted until the spell has been learned from one of the archeologists cleaning finds in the museum. To learn how to enchant a ruby necklace, a player must first participate in cleaning rsrc1218 until a rsrc4461 is found in the sample, and the chance of finding the necklace is 1/51. When brought to any of the archaeologists in the Digsite cleaning event, the archaeologist will teach the player how to replicate the enchantment spell. Note: The clean necklace will be removed from your inventory after talking to one of the archeologists. When enchanted, the pendant can be used to rsrc16098 to the north of the rsrc1425, west of the Digsite barge. The number of charges on an individual pendant is suffixed to the item's name. For example, an unused pendant is named \"Digsite pendant (5)\". When all five teleports have been used, the pendant will crumble away. Players could cast rsrc8 on it when only 1 charge is left to minimise costs. Once the quest rsrc1236 has been completed, a pendant of any amount of charges can be used on the strange machine (the one displaying a book with symbols) at the rsrc1235, north of the rsrc702 in rsrc1238. The pendant, along with future Digsite pendants used, will gain an extra teleport option to the House on the Hill. Once rsrc16118 has been completed, a teleport to rsrc926 can be unlocked by using a Digsite pendant on the strange machinery north of the rsrc16119. Each teleport option can also be unbound by using the pendant on the machine again.  ",

While equipped, the necklace provides a 25% chance to prevent the player from being rsrc3080 and damaged while rsrc16050 rsrc15930. The necklace begins with 10 charges; one charge is consumed each time the necklace successfully prevents damage. When the last charge is consumed, the necklace crumbles to dust. As the player cannot fail a pickpocket attempt on a knocked out NPC, damage taken during rsrc16120 can only be received by failing a knockout; as such, a dodgy necklace will have no effect on blackjacking. As in the case of other enchanted items of jewellery (such as the rsrc5378), the charges stored on this necklace are specific to the player, not the item itself. This means that players will lose a dodgy necklace after 10 uses irrespective of the particular one they have equipped, and all dodgy necklaces will show the same charge when checked. Depending on the NPC being pickpocketed, one necklace can prevent 10 to 50 damage and 40 to 60 seconds of being stunned.   The name is a pun on being dodgy, meaning being deceitful and dishonest like a pickpocket, and dodging NPC stun attacks. Upon release, the examine text for the dodgy necklace was Let's you get away with it - sometimes. The extra apostrophe in \"Let's\" was not removed until over a year later in rsrc16121 on 5 April rsrc231.",

Wearing the necklace requires level 80 in rsrc81, and currently offers the highest rsrc15902 in the neck slot in Old School RuneScape. When worn, it will restore prayer points as bones are buried (even if buried via the rsrc3277). However, this prayer restoring effect takes nine seconds to take effect after equipping the necklace; this is to prevent players equipping another necklace and only swapping to the dragonbone necklace each time they kill a monster just for the prayer restoration effect. A small sound effect can be heard when the nine seconds have passed. This effect does not stack with the rsrc1323 prayer restoration effect. The amount of points restored are as follows:   Upon release, the necklace had a +6 prayer bonus, and equipping the necklace reduced remaining prayer points by half. This was changed to +12 instead and the latter effect replaced with the nine-second waiting period in rsrc16122 on 25 January 2018.",

Blessing by Jered requires at least 31 Prayer. They have the third highest prayer bonus for an amulet in game (after the god rsrc1084 and rsrc3279).

A holy symbol is required for rsrc147 and rsrc2254. You can make a holy symbol by using a rsrc1925 on a furnace with a rsrc6980. You will get an rsrc6984 and can then use a rsrc1373 on it. Wearing a holy symbol will decrease the chance of rsrc2317 healing when attacked (this healing is similar to rsrc4297).

It is purely offensive, offering the highest rsrc78 attack bonus, as well as being the only neck slot item to offer a rsrc469 bonus. Players can make one by enchanting a zenyte necklace with the rsrc1135 spell. This requires level 93 rsrc59, 20 rsrc1132, 20 rsrc1137, and 1 rsrc1136 and grants 110 Magic rsrc19. Players can attach an rsrc1422, obtained from rsrc15927, to create a rsrc1423. This is only cosmetic, and does not affect the necklace's stat bonuses. It can be dismantled, returning the necklace and ornament kit.   In the original Developer's Blog, it was proposed that zenyte jewellery, in addition to its stats, would provide a passive healing effect provided that it was charged with a cut rsrc2819rsrc274. Charged zenyte jewellery equipped would have a 10% chance of healing 5% of the damage dealt to a target. This effect would last for 10,000 successful hits, which when depleted would return the zenyte jewellery to its uncharged state and would require another onyx to become charged again.This was polled in the Old School Content Poll #39, where it only received 69.1% votes in favour, 5.9% short of passing the poll. This necklace looks similar to the rsrc16128 in RuneScape 3. This necklace is one of the few non-ammo slot items to provide a range strength bonus, along with the rsrc547 and rsrc1814.",

    "article-text": "The occult necklace is a magical amulet that requires 70 rsrc59 to wear. It is dropped by the rsrc818 and its rsrc1359. Wearing it increases the player's rsrc5740 by 10%, and is the only amulet to give such a bonus. This 10% bonus will also stack with existing boosts, such as the rsrc276. A combination of the occult necklace and rsrc276 while using rsrc2988 would increase a player's max hit to 38, from an original maximum of 30. The max hit increases to 42 if using a rsrc2785 or rsrc282 on a rsrc16024. Players can attach an rsrc8356, obtained from rsrc15927, to cosmetically enhance the necklace, creating an rsrc8357. This only alters its appearance, and gives no stat enhancements. It can be dismantled, returning the necklace and ornament kit.   Even though it is classified as a necklace, it appears to be strung, which would make it an rsrc997 in Runescape's terms. The necklace seems to be based on Runescape 3's rsrc16131. Most pieces of equipment providing magic attack bonus also provide the same amount in magic defence. The occult necklace does not. Prior to an update, the necklace's examine was \"A satanic evil embodies this amulet.\"",

Its bonus can be increased to 20% when made into a rsrc271. To recover one's salve amulet, one only needs to crawl through the cart-tunnel immediately south of the main entrance (merely a few steps away from the main entrance), and use a chisel on any crystal outcrop to obtain salve shards, which can later be strung with balls of wool to make salve amulets. NOTE: You will NOT need to go through all six levels of the Haunted Mine, and NEITHER will you need to bring a light source to obtain a salve shard needed to make a salve amulet.

Brundt the Chieftain will replace seals of passage for free if a player loses or destroys it. Brundt will not, however, give players a second one if they already have one in their possession - be it in the bank, on their person, or in their inventory. If a player should ask about obtaining another seal while already having one, he only compliments your expeditions on Lunar Isle, and the conversation ends shortly after. Because Brundt replaces players' Seals of passage, it is advisable for players who have not completed Lunar Diplomacy to destroy their seal of passage after completing their visit to Lunar Isle. The reason being is that most players forget their previously banked seal, and don't have access to a nearby bank for retrieval. Contrarily, if a player has destroyed their seal, Brundt will happily give them another, as he possesses an infinite amount of them. Once you have completed the rsrc16135, you no longer need a Seal of Passage to get in Lunar Isle.   At 4.5kg, it is the heaviest item that can be worn in the neckwear slot.",

To wear Ahrim's hood, a player must have 70 rsrc30 and 70 rsrc59. The hood is generally considered to be among the poorer rsrc807 because of its low rsrc16133 value, and is seldom used by players in favour of the rsrc809, unless the set effect is desired. Compared to the Farseer helm, Ahrim's hood has higher level requirements to wear but no quest requirements. However, the hood provides an identical magic attack bonus and incurs repair costs. Being part of Ahrim's barrows set, if Ahrim's hood is worn along with all of the other pieces of equipment in Ahrim's barrows set the player receives a special effect: This piece of armour cannot be made using the rsrc74 rsrc15940, but can be obtained as a reward from the rsrc797 minigame. As with all Barrows equipment,  Barrows equipment rsrc16152 as it is used. Equipment received from the Barrows minigame is fully repaired and can be used for 15 hours of combat until it degrades completely and requires repair before it can be used again. Barrows armour degrades even if the player is using protection prayers or not taking damage. Unlike the rsrc802 and rsrc794, Barrows equipment does not suffer in performance as it degrades from fully repaired to fully degraded. Fully repaired Barrows items start out with no numbers in their names, e.g. Ahrim's hood. It will become Ahrim's hood 100 the first time it's used in combat. Eventually it will degrade to Ahrim's hood 75, then 50, then 25 and finally 0 at which point the armour will be unusable until repaired. Additionally, Barrows equipment may only be traded if fully repaired or fully degraded. When dropped or lost on death, any piece of Barrows equipment will automatically degrade to 0. Players who attempt to drop Barrows equipment will receive a warning message about this. There are two ways to repair Barrows armour. Players can talk to any of the NPCs listed below and they will repair the items for a price, or repair the pieces themselves using an rsrc804 in any rsrc156. The equipment can be repaired at any stage, and the cost will be adjusted according to how much it has degraded. The repair costs below are as if the equipment has fully degraded. The following NPCs can repair the armour: Enter your smithing level here to calculate how much it would cost to repair the Ahrim's hood on an rsrc804: ",

The black mask is a rare drop from rsrc2442, which many people kill as black masks are  highly valuable. However, killing them requires 58 rsrc285 and the completion of rsrc2644, which deters many players from killing them. When dropped by Cave horrors, the mask has 10 charges that will be discharged to monsters at random. These charges reduce the opponent's Defence by 3-10 levels. Once the mask has been drained of all 10 charges, there is no way to recharge it; however, the Attack and Strength boosts still remain. For 1,250,000 rsrc238 points, players can upgrade a black mask to a rsrc2785. A Black mask with charges (1-10) may also be imbued. Players may rsrc16165 a black mask and other Slayer items into a rsrc282, provided they have rsrc293 to make the helmets.  ",

To obtain a bronze full helm the player can either buy one from the rsrc477 in the rsrc594, obtain one as a rsrc597 drop, make one using the rsrc74 skill or trade with another player. To create a bronze full helmet the player needs at least 7 rsrc74, a rsrc422 and two rsrc3598. To make a helmet use one of the bars on an rsrc438 with the hammer in the inventory. This will grant the player 25 Smithing experience. ",

To wear Dharok's helm, a player must have 70 rsrc30. As it is part of Dharok's barrows set, if Dharok's helm is worn along with all of the other pieces of equipment in Dharok's barrows set the player gains a special effect. Attacks do more damage as the player's rsrc65 decrease, up to 98.9% bonus damage with 1 hitpoint remaining with 99 max. As with all rsrc807, this item cannot be made using the rsrc74 rsrc15940.  Barrows equipment rsrc16152 as it is used. Equipment received from the Barrows minigame is fully repaired and can be used for 15 hours of combat until it degrades completely and requires repair before it can be used again. Barrows armour degrades even if the player is using protection prayers or not taking damage. Unlike the rsrc802 and rsrc794, Barrows equipment does not suffer in performance as it degrades from fully repaired to fully degraded. Fully repaired Barrows items start out with no numbers in their names, e.g. Dharok's helm. It will become Dharok's helm 100 the first time it's used in combat. Eventually it will degrade to Dharok's helm 75, then 50, then 25 and finally 0 at which point the armour will be unusable until repaired. Additionally, Barrows equipment may only be traded if fully repaired or fully degraded. When dropped or lost on death, any piece of Barrows equipment will automatically degrade to 0. Players who attempt to drop Barrows equipment will receive a warning message about this. There are two ways to repair Barrows armour. Players can talk to any of the NPCs listed below and they will repair the items for a price, or repair the pieces themselves using an rsrc804 in any rsrc156. The equipment can be repaired at any stage, and the cost will be adjusted according to how much it has degraded. The repair costs below are as if the equipment has fully degraded. The following NPCs can repair the armour: Enter your smithing level here to calculate how much it would cost to repair the Dharok's helm on an rsrc804: ",

Alternatively, players can receive one from a rsrc4351 after lighting a pyre ship with rsrc4346. The chance of this occurring is 1/250. However, chewed bones themselves can only be obtained from mithril dragons as an uncommon drop, with a drop rate of 1/42. Combining the drop rates, the expected number of kills to receive one is 10,500.   rsrc622 formerly dropped the full helm with a matching drop rate of 1 in 32,768, but this was removed in rsrc16185 on 13 July rsrc125 as part of a balancing change.

In contrast, the druidic wreath in Old School RuneScape is very common. The druidic wreath was rsrc14782 on rsrc16189 due to the model breaking the polygon count limit. Upon making the druidic wreath available from rsrc1141 in rsrc16190 on 19 July rsrc231, it was not made into a rsrc375 item. This resulted in free-to-play players being able to purchase the item, but not equip it, as it was marked as a rsrc16191. This was corrected in rsrc16141 the next week.",

    "article-text": "The gold helmet is a rsrc16148 you must smith during the rsrc2268 quest using 3 rsrc3. You get 30 rsrc74 experience for making it. More than one helmet can be made by using the drop trick and casting rsrc789 on the helmets you've dropped on the ground. You must wear it to use rsrc16203's cannon to enter the massive rsrc16204, which are found in the mines south of rsrc672. During the quest, once in the mines, the helmet will begin to get heavy. Because of this, a player may only stay in the mines for eight minutes before the helmet becomes so heavy that they are magically forced out. After the quest, the helmet will not force players out, although it must still be worn to enter the mines. It is the heaviest piece of equipment in the game. To leave the mines, a player must remove the helmet. When this is done, they will automatically be teleported outside. This costs the player one inventory space, so some players log out instead; if a player logs out in the mines, they will automatically be teleported outside. To make the helmet after the quest, have 3 gold bars and a hammer in your inventory and smith it on any anvil (option won't be available if you have one in your bank already). Smithing a gold helmet in the rsrc705 is a medium task in the rsrc16205.  ",

To wear Guthan's helm, a player must have 70 rsrc30. Being part of Guthan's set, if Guthan's helm is worn along with all of the other pieces of equipment in Guthan's set the player receives a special effect. rsrc16210 have a chance of replenishing rsrc65 equal to the damage the player deals. This piece of armour cannot be made using the rsrc74 rsrc15940. Despite Guthan's having more than average combat stats, it is mostly used by players to heal (and saves space that would have been used bringing rsrc184) and then they revert back to their regular melee armour. This method saves money and ultimately puts off having to repair the armour as regularly.  Barrows equipment rsrc16152 as it is used. Equipment received from the Barrows minigame is fully repaired and can be used for 15 hours of combat until it degrades completely and requires repair before it can be used again. Barrows armour degrades even if the player is using protection prayers or not taking damage. Unlike the rsrc802 and rsrc794, Barrows equipment does not suffer in performance as it degrades from fully repaired to fully degraded. Fully repaired Barrows items start out with no numbers in their names, e.g. Guthan's helm. It will become Guthan's helm 100 the first time it's used in combat. Eventually it will degrade to Guthan's helm 75, then 50, then 25 and finally 0 at which point the armour will be unusable until repaired. Additionally, Barrows equipment may only be traded if fully repaired or fully degraded. When dropped or lost on death, any piece of Barrows equipment will automatically degrade to 0. Players who attempt to drop Barrows equipment will receive a warning message about this. There are two ways to repair Barrows armour. Players can talk to any of the NPCs listed below and they will repair the items for a price, or repair the pieces themselves using an rsrc804 in any rsrc156. The equipment can be repaired at any stage, and the cost will be adjusted according to how much it has degraded. The repair costs below are as if the equipment has fully degraded. The following NPCs can repair the armour: Enter your smithing level here to calculate how much it would cost to repair the Guthan's helm on an rsrc804: ",

To wear Karil's coif, a player must have 70 rsrc30 and 70 rsrc78. Being part of Karil's barrows set, if Karil's coif is worn along with all of the other pieces of equipment in Karil's barrows set the player gains a special effect. On successful attacks with rsrc1677 against a player, there is a chance that it may temporarily lower that player's rsrc505 level. This piece of armour cannot be made using the rsrc263 rsrc15940.  Barrows equipment rsrc16152 as it is used. Equipment received from the Barrows minigame is fully repaired and can be used for 15 hours of combat until it degrades completely and requires repair before it can be used again. Barrows armour degrades even if the player is using protection prayers or not taking damage. Unlike the rsrc802 and rsrc794, Barrows equipment does not suffer in performance as it degrades from fully repaired to fully degraded. Fully repaired Barrows items start out with no numbers in their names, e.g. Karil's coif. It will become Karil's coif 100 the first time it's used in combat. Eventually it will degrade to Karil's coif 75, then 50, then 25 and finally 0 at which point the armour will be unusable until repaired. Additionally, Barrows equipment may only be traded if fully repaired or fully degraded. When dropped or lost on death, any piece of Barrows equipment will automatically degrade to 0. Players who attempt to drop Barrows equipment will receive a warning message about this. There are two ways to repair Barrows armour. Players can talk to any of the NPCs listed below and they will repair the items for a price, or repair the pieces themselves using an rsrc804 in any rsrc156. The equipment can be repaired at any stage, and the cost will be adjusted according to how much it has degraded. The repair costs below are as if the equipment has fully degraded. The following NPCs can repair the armour: Enter your smithing level here to calculate how much it would cost to repair the Karil's coif on an rsrc804:  The Karil's coif previously had a ranged attack bonus of +3.

Players may buy a set of the hood and the cape from Mac for 2,277,000 coins, which is 99,000 coins times 23, the number of skills. The hood itself provides absolutely no offensive or defensive bonuses and may be worn for purely aesthetic purposes. While the hood is bought with the skillcape, it is not needed to perform the rsrc309 associated with it; the skillcape is the only essential item. Along with the cape, the hood may be stored in the rsrc344 of a rsrc156. Should players lose the hood, they may reclaim it from Mac for free. The max hood must be in the player's inventory when they are combining a max cape with other cape slot items, such as the rsrc6107.  ",

    "article-text": "The progress hat is a magical, talking hat used to keep track of your current rsrc1428 obtained from the rsrc1349. It replies with a sour attitude toward your character when asked about your points. It is free to replace, just speak to the entrance guardian. The hat has a maximum point storage limit, as follows: The hat will glow brighter in order to show you how many points you have gained and how many you can still earn. There are three stages - Dull, Energised, and Full. The transition between dull and energised seems to occur at around 9,000 total pizazz points, and the final transition at around 16,000 points. Oddly, in spite of being a magical hat that speaks when operated (when worn) or is talked to, it provides no stat bonuses.   Although the name while worn or in your inventory is progress hat, in chat its name is Pizazz Hat. Prior to rsrc16239 on 16 November rsrc125, destroying the progress hat meant that the player loses all their pizazz points.",

Rune full helms are preferred over rune med helms in almost all circumstances; the only reason a rune med helm would be used in place of the full helm variety is if the player is low on funds and cannot afford the additional outlay. To create a rune full helm, the player needs at least level 92 Smithing, a rsrc422 and two rsrc15953. Smithing a rune full helm on an rsrc438 grants 150 Smithing experience.  ",

Along with the cape, the hood may be stored in the rsrc344 of a rsrc156. Should players lose the hood, they may reclaim it from Aubury for free.  ",

The Runner hat provides a slightly higher magic defence bonus (+1) as compared to the that of the rune full helm's (-1) and its variants. It also lacks a negative attack bonus for ranged and magic attacks. The Runner Hat has a weight of only 1 kg,while most other helmets weigh at least 2 kg if not more. The hat is largely used by anyone who is looking to show prestige in Barbarian Assault.

Its bonuses are comparable to those of the rsrc807, however, unlike the rsrc9307, the serpentine helm offers no rsrc15902.                         The helmet is charged with rsrc1344, requiring 11,000 scales to fully charge it, costing 2,882,000. It cannot be equipped if it is uncharged, except when fully degraded while equipped. When fully charged, the helmet will last for 15 hours of combat before returning to its uncharged state. The serpentine helm provides two rsrc1673: The chances of inflicting venom when the player damages a monster with the helmet equipped are as follows: If a player dies with the helmet in PVP and it is not protected, any scales that were used to charge it will appear on the floor along with the uncharged helmet. In addition, players can dismantle an uncharged helm to receive 20,000 rsrc1344, resulting in a loss of -65,964 coins. The player can use mutagens dropped by Zulrah to recolour the serpentine helm into one of its two colour variants: using a rsrc7751 creates a rsrc7750, and using a rsrc9308 creates a rsrc9310. These variants do not apply any stat changes and are purely cosmetic. The only way to obtain the recoloured helmets is by killing rsrc688 herself, as the mutagens or recoloured helmets cannot be traded.  Upon release, if an opponent attacked a player with the helmet equipped, there was a 1 in 6 chance (16.7%) they would be inflicted with rsrc1342, providing that they weren't immune to poison. In addition, the helmet had a +5 strength bonus. The envenoming effect and strength bonus were removed and reduced (to +3) respectively in rsrc16250 on 25 May rsrc125. Due to player complaints about the serpentine helm being left with no offensive benefits in comparison to the much cheaper rsrc4545 given the previous change, an rsrc16251 the next day brought back the envenoming capabilities of the helmet. However, it will only work against NPCs that the player damages with melee.

    "article-text": "The Slayer helmet is a single item worn in the head slot that combines multiple pieces of protective and beneficial rsrc16252. It may be assembled after a player spends 400 rsrc16253 to learn how to craft one, additionally requiring level 55 rsrc263 (boosts work). The attack and defensive bonuses are the same as that of a rsrc475. When worn, the helmet provides the special effects of all of the rsrc285 equipment which it was made from. The slayer helmet requires 10 rsrc30 to equip. Despite the helmet requiring a rsrc8275 which requires 60 Slayer to equip, the Slayer helmet requires no particular Slayer level to wear. When worn on a rsrc16024, the helm provides a melee boost of 16.67% against slayer tasks. Should the player want a similar boost for ranged and magic, they must imbue it through rsrc238, which is detailed below. On PvP death, the slayer helm is converted to a rsrc1710 for the enemy player. It cannot be repaired like other untradeables.rsrc274  For players with rsrc277 Slayer assignments, the boosts given by the rsrc1086 or rsrc271 do not stack with the effects of a Slayer helmet. If a player owns the Salve amulet (e) or rsrc4371, it may be worth it to switch to a better helmet and wear the amulet instead, since it gives 20% accuracy and damage bonus, as opposed to the 16.67% rsrc507 or 15% rsrc59 and rsrc78 boosts the helmet grants. However, this 3.33 - 5% boost from the Salve amulet may be less damage overall than if you were to have a different amulet with the Slayer helmet, as most helmets provide less offensive bonuses than comparable amulets. For example, the rsrc1076 provides +10 Strength bonus, whereas a rsrc4545 only provides +3. Overall, the torture + Slayer helmet combination provides more damage output than a Neitiznot helmet and Salve amulet. This is also the case for the rsrc1075 and rsrc266, as well as the rsrc1085 and rsrc57 for ranged and magic. Assembling the helmet requires the player to purchase the Malevolent masquerade ability from a rsrc1956, costing 400 rsrc16253. In addition, level 55 rsrc263 is required to craft the helmet; boosts will work when assembling it. The items used to assemble the slayer helmet are: At the cost of 1,250,000 rsrc238 reward points, the Slayer helmet can be upgraded to a rsrc286, adding a 15% damage boost to both rsrc59 and rsrc78. The Slayer helmet (i) also has a +10 magic defence bonus, a +3 magic attack bonus and a +3 ranged attack bonus. With 1,000 rsrc293, the player can learn how to recolour the helmet (or its imbued variant) by using certain special items on it. Each recolour ability is purchased separately, meaning 5,000 slayer reward points are required to fully access all the recolours, provided the player has the items readily available. Players can disassemble the recoloured helmet to retrieve the items back. All recolours are purely aesthetic. The items that can be combined are as follows: The slayer helmet was the first item to conform (either by remodelling or conversion [unclear from source]) to the Old School model format (from a later undefined format) and to be introduced to the game.rsrc5332 The slayer helmet's appearance was rsrc14782 in rsrc16254 on 13 September rsrc231 after passing rsrc16255. Its appearance was altered to use the original colours from when it was first introduced to RuneScape on 5 June 2008. When combined with a black mask (10), it will lose its charges.",

To wear Torag's helmet, a player must have 70 rsrc30. Being part of Torag's barrows set, if Torag's helmet is worn along with all of the other pieces of equipment in Torag's barrows set the player gains a set effect. Damaging melee attacks have a chance of lowering the victim's rsrc15971 by 20%. This piece of armour cannot be made using the rsrc74 rsrc15940. Torag's helmet is not commonly used due to its lack of rsrc305 or rsrc16263. Furthermore, the set effect is considered mediocre. As a result, it is inexpensive compared to the other barrows helmets. * - Torag's helmet is only tradeable when undamaged or fully broken.  Barrows equipment rsrc16152 as it is used. Equipment received from the Barrows minigame is fully repaired and can be used for 15 hours of combat until it degrades completely and requires repair before it can be used again. Barrows armour degrades even if the player is using protection prayers or not taking damage. Unlike the rsrc802 and rsrc794, Barrows equipment does not suffer in performance as it degrades from fully repaired to fully degraded. Fully repaired Barrows items start out with no numbers in their names, e.g. Torag's helm. It will become Torag's helm 100 the first time it's used in combat. Eventually it will degrade to Torag's helm 75, then 50, then 25 and finally 0 at which point the armour will be unusable until repaired. Additionally, Barrows equipment may only be traded if fully repaired or fully degraded. When dropped or lost on death, any piece of Barrows equipment will automatically degrade to 0. Players who attempt to drop Barrows equipment will receive a warning message about this. There are two ways to repair Barrows armour. Players can talk to any of the NPCs listed below and they will repair the items for a price, or repair the pieces themselves using an rsrc804 in any rsrc156. The equipment can be repaired at any stage, and the cost will be adjusted according to how much it has degraded. The repair costs below are as if the equipment has fully degraded. The following NPCs can repair the armour: Enter your smithing level here to calculate how much it would cost to repair the Torag's helm on an rsrc804: ",

To wear Verac's helmet, a player must have 70 rsrc30. This piece of armour cannot be made using the rsrc74 rsrc15940. Being part of Verac's set, when Verac's helm is worn, along with all of the other pieces of equipment in the set, successful attacks have a chance of hitting through an opponent's rsrc30 and rsrc81, potentially causing heavy damage. Verac's helm has a lesser rsrc59 penalty compared to other helmets at 0+ rsrc15950 but slightly less rsrc78 defence bonuses compared to rsrc6819 or rsrc7284, which are equal bonuses. This helmet is often used in 'rsrc16265' combat due to the high defensive bonuses as well as a rsrc15902. This helmet is commonly used during the rsrc4994 minigame because of its good melee and ranged defence and prayer bonus.  Barrows equipment rsrc16152 as it is used. Equipment received from the Barrows minigame is fully repaired and can be used for 15 hours of combat until it degrades completely and requires repair before it can be used again. Barrows armour degrades even if the player is using protection prayers or not taking damage. Unlike the rsrc802 and rsrc794, Barrows equipment does not suffer in performance as it degrades from fully repaired to fully degraded. Fully repaired Barrows items start out with no numbers in their names, e.g. Verac's helm. It will become Verac's helm 100 the first time it's used in combat. Eventually it will degrade to Verac's helm 75, then 50, then 25 and finally 0 at which point the armour will be unusable until repaired. Additionally, Barrows equipment may only be traded if fully repaired or fully degraded. When dropped or lost on death, any piece of Barrows equipment will automatically degrade to 0. Players who attempt to drop Barrows equipment will receive a warning message about this. There are two ways to repair Barrows armour. Players can talk to any of the NPCs listed below and they will repair the items for a price, or repair the pieces themselves using an rsrc804 in any rsrc156. The equipment can be repaired at any stage, and the cost will be adjusted according to how much it has degraded. The repair costs below are as if the equipment has fully degraded. The following NPCs can repair the armour: Enter your smithing level here to calculate how much it would cost to repair the Verac's helm on an rsrc804: ",

The helm can be bought at the rsrc675 shop in rsrc678 for 78,000 rsrc321. Due to its lack of a strength bonus, the warrior helm is far less popular than its counterpart, the rsrc2450, despite having a small rsrc15936 bonus (+5) and better defence against the widely used slash attack (+33 instead of +29). However, it is a good alternative for the rsrc6094, assuming those who plan to use the Warrior helm are using a slash weapon, especially considering that it provides slightly better resistance to all attacks.

To wear Ahrim's robe top, a player must have 70 rsrc30 and 70 rsrc59. Being part of Ahrim's barrows set, if Ahrim's robe top is worn along with all of the other pieces of equipment in Ahrim's barrows set the player gains a special attack. Successful rsrc59 attacks have a chance of temporarily lowering the opponent's rsrc64 level. This piece of armour cannot be made using the rsrc74 rsrc15940.  Barrows equipment rsrc16152 as it is used. Equipment received from the Barrows minigame is fully repaired and can be used for 15 hours of combat until it degrades completely and requires repair before it can be used again. Barrows armour degrades even if the player is using protection prayers or not taking damage. Unlike the rsrc802 and rsrc794, Barrows equipment does not suffer in performance as it degrades from fully repaired to fully degraded. Fully repaired Barrows items start out with no numbers in their names, e.g. Ahrim's robetop. It will become Ahrim's robetop 100 the first time it's used in combat. Eventually it will degrade to Ahrim's robetop 75, then 50, then 25 and finally 0 at which point the armour will be unusable until repaired. Additionally, Barrows equipment may only be traded if fully repaired or fully degraded. When dropped or lost on death, any piece of Barrows equipment will automatically degrade to 0. Players who attempt to drop Barrows equipment will receive a warning message about this. There are two ways to repair Barrows armour. Players can talk to any of the NPCs listed below and they will repair the items for a price, or repair the pieces themselves using an rsrc804 in any rsrc156. The equipment can be repaired at any stage, and the cost will be adjusted according to how much it has degraded. The repair costs below are as if the equipment has fully degraded. The following NPCs can repair the armour:  The torso area of the top resembles a metal chainbody and it interferes with accumulators.",

Unlike the other body armours which provide a strength bonus, the Bandos chestplate also has substantial defensive bonuses.  Bandos armour is among the most powerful melee armours in Old School RuneScape. Because it never degrades, it is ideal for rsrc2114, rsrc16273, and other prolonged combat encounters. Stat-wise, it is comparable to the rsrc807, with minor differences.  The inventory sprite for the Bandos chestplate is missing both the shoulder spikes and the sleeve. It also resembles the male version of the chestplate more than the female version. A minor graphical error occurs when equipping a rsrc15966 with the Bandos chestplate; the cape's left shoulder piece seems to merge with the chestplate's pauldron. The Bandos chestplate does not interfere with rsrc3213. The Bandos chestplate does not penalise the wearer's magic attack bonus as much as a regular rsrc1878. When performing the rsrc14159 emote with the chestplate equipped, the player's left arm will visibly detach from their torso.",

    "article-text": "Dharok's platebody is rsrc16183 worn in the rsrc16269 that is part of rsrc16184 of rsrc807. To wear Dharok's platebody, a player must have 70 rsrc30. Being part of Dharok's barrows set, if Dharok's platebody is worn along with all of the other pieces of equipment in Dharok's set the player receives a special effect: attacks do more damage as the player's rsrc65 decrease, up to 98.9% bonus damage with 1 hitpoint remaining at 99 hitpoints. Although the degrading deters many poorer players, it takes around 5 hours to degrade from 100 to 75, and is relatively cheap to repair. As with all rsrc807, this item cannot be made using the rsrc74 rsrc15940.  Barrows equipment rsrc16152 as it is used. Equipment received from the Barrows minigame is fully repaired and can be used for 15 hours of combat until it degrades completely and requires repair before it can be used again. Barrows armour degrades even if the player is using protection prayers or not taking damage. Unlike the rsrc802 and rsrc794, Barrows equipment does not suffer in performance as it degrades from fully repaired to fully degraded. Fully repaired Barrows items start out with no numbers in their names, e.g. Dharok's platebody. It will become Dharok's platebody 100 the first time it's used in combat. Eventually it will degrade to Dharok's platebody 75, then 50, then 25 and finally 0 at which point the armour will be unusable until repaired. Additionally, Barrows equipment may only be traded if fully repaired or fully degraded. When dropped or lost on death, any piece of Barrows equipment will automatically degrade to 0. Players who attempt to drop Barrows equipment will receive a warning message about this. There are two ways to repair Barrows armour. Players can talk to any of the NPCs listed below and they will repair the items for a price, or repair the pieces themselves using an rsrc804 in any rsrc156. The equipment can be repaired at any stage, and the cost will be adjusted according to how much it has degraded. The repair costs below are as if the equipment has fully degraded. The following NPCs can repair the armour: Enter your smithing level here to calculate how much it would cost to repair the Dharok's platebody on an rsrc804: ",

One must have a rsrc30 level of 60 to equip a Dragon chainbody. It is dropped by the rsrc2464, the rsrc1359, and both rsrc685 and rsrc818 (including their rsrc1317 rsrc5438). The Kalphite Queen has the highest drop rate for the chainbody at a rate of 1/128, followed by the Thermonuclear smoke devil at 1/2,000. Both dust and smoke devils (and superior variants) have the rarest drop rate of them all, at a rate of 1/32,768 as confirmed by Mod Ash during a livestream. Dust devils requires 65 rsrc285 to harm while smoke devils require 93 Slayer and a task. It can also be won from the minigame rsrc1860 if a player gambles their points, although this is not suggested due to its rarity, which is approximately 1/16,000. Despite its rarity, dragon armour is surpassed in bonuses by many other armour sets, most notably armour from the rsrc5439. The chainbody's lack of strength bonus also means it is commonly substituted for pieces such as the rsrc5441 for general training. As with most rsrc16186, players cannot make this item using the Smithing skill. A dragon chainbody, rsrc5436 and rsrc5437 are required in order to forge a rsrc5407. This process requires 90 rsrc74. A dragon chainbody can be combined with a rsrc5442 to make a gold-trimmed rsrc5440. This cosmetic enhancement won't change the stats in any way.  ",

Fighter torsos can be purchased from rsrc1862 in exchange for 375 rsrc6097 in all four roles and having killed the rsrc6096. You can use the Fighter torso on Commander Connad to sell it back for 300 rsrc6097 in all four roles. If the player dies below level 20 rsrc464, it will remain in the player's inventory. However, the item will be unusable and must be repaired with 50,000 coins by using the item on rsrc465 or an Armour stand in a PvP world. Please note that while this item is obtainable by any player, lower-levelled characters may struggle to fulfill the attacker role within the Barbarian Assault minigame and must be more closely monitored by healers. Thus, obtaining this item on a character of below level 65 rsrc173 should only be attempted by experienced users. Compared to a rsrc1303, the fighter torso has generally inferior defence bonuses and a greater magic penalty, but has slightly higher slash defence, and no negative ranged bonus. Also, it is tied with the rsrc2102 for having the highest strength bonus (+4) for the body equipment slot. Due to its strength bonus, it is a good choice for general training, where maximising one's damage output will often take precedence over defensive bonuses. Like the other Penance equipment, the fighter torso weighs significantly less than regular armour. This makes it useful for situations such as quests where the player must travel a lot but may be required to fend off some enemies. Because of its unusually high negative magic attack bonus, it is highly effective for rsrc5066. Furthermore, the fighter torso is also a good choice of armour for players who wish to avoid completing rsrc525 for any reason, such as to prevent dragon slayer tasks. The fighter torso does not interfere with rsrc3213. The fighter torso is an item used in a master clue, requested by Falo the Bard. Along with other Penance equipment, the torso used to cost (5) Queen Kills in addition to 375 in each role.",

Players who have killed the rsrc6096 and have 95,000 coins can purchase the armour from rsrc1862, located on the ground floor of the rsrc2215. It is the only item from the rsrc1860 rsrc15988 that cannot be obtained with rsrc6097. The Granite body is the most commonly used piece of the granite armour set as it is the only one that provides higher bonuses in every stat over its rune equivalent, the rsrc1303. Even though it is seen as low-level armour, the granite body has superior defensive bonuses to a rsrc5441 by a good margin, except the slash defence, which is 1 lower. The granite body is a good choice for players who do not want to spend millions on rsrc2103 or rsrc16290. Compared to the dragon chainbody, the granite body provides better range defence and stab defence but weaker by 9 and 19 points in slash and crush respectively. It should be noted that the granite body is far heavier than its alternatives, which may make it impractical for situations such as rsrc15898 which require prolonged travel. It is required to purchase and equip this item as part of the hard tasks of the Kandarin achievement diary. It cannot be purchased from anywhere except Commander Connad to meet the requirement for the task, requiring the Penance Queen be killed at least once by the player to be completed.   The granite body is the only tradeable piece of equipment available as a non-gamble reward from Barbarian Assault. The granite body is by far the heaviest body armour in RuneScape, weighing 22 kilograms.",

To wear Guthan's platebody, a player must have 70 rsrc30. Being part of the rsrc16292, if Guthan's platebody is worn along with all of the other pieces of equipment in the set, the player receives a special effect. Successful attacks have a chance of replenishing one rsrc16130 for each point of damage the player deals. As with all rsrc807, this item cannot be made using the rsrc74 rsrc15940. Guthan's armour is often used by players to heal (thus saving inventory space on food) and then switch to non-degradable melee armour afterwards. This method saves money and ultimately puts off having to repair the armour as regularly. The healing set effect also proves useful for training rsrc285.  Barrows equipment rsrc16152 as it is used. Equipment received from the Barrows minigame is fully repaired and can be used for 15 hours of combat until it degrades completely and requires repair before it can be used again. Barrows armour degrades even if the player is using protection prayers or not taking damage. Unlike the rsrc802 and rsrc794, Barrows equipment does not suffer in performance as it degrades from fully repaired to fully degraded. Fully repaired Barrows items start out with no numbers in their names, e.g. Guthan's platebody. It will become Guthan's platebody 100 the first time it's used in combat. Eventually it will degrade to Guthan's platebody 75, then 50, then 25 and finally 0 at which point the armour will be unusable until repaired. Additionally, Barrows equipment may only be traded if fully repaired or fully degraded. When dropped or lost on death, any piece of Barrows equipment will automatically degrade to 0. Players who attempt to drop Barrows equipment will receive a warning message about this. There are two ways to repair Barrows armour. Players can talk to any of the NPCs listed below and they will repair the items for a price, or repair the pieces themselves using an rsrc804 in any rsrc156. The equipment can be repaired at any stage, and the cost will be adjusted according to how much it has degraded. The repair costs below are as if the equipment has fully degraded. The following NPCs can repair the armour: Enter your smithing level here to calculate how much it would cost to repair the Guthan's platebody on an rsrc804: ",

To wear Karil's top, a player must have 70 rsrc30 and 70 rsrc78. Being part of Karil's barrows set, if Karil's top is worn along with all of the other pieces of equipment in Karil's barrows set the player gains a special effect. On rsrc16210 with rsrc1677 against a player, there is a chance that it may temporarily lower that player's rsrc505 level. This piece of armour cannot be made using the rsrc263 skill.  Karil's top is the second most powerful ranged armour after the rsrc1657 (tied with both rsrc110 and rsrc16295 in attack bonus). If the set effect or rsrc15950 is not desired, it may be practical to opt for a black d'hide body instead; Karil's armour has slightly poorer rsrc507 defence, must be repaired, and costs a relatively hefty amount to purchase on the rsrc490. Barrows equipment rsrc16152 as it is used. Equipment received from the Barrows minigame is fully repaired and can be used for 15 hours of combat until it degrades completely and requires repair before it can be used again. Barrows armour degrades even if the player is using protection prayers or not taking damage. Unlike the rsrc802 and rsrc794, Barrows equipment does not suffer in performance as it degrades from fully repaired to fully degraded. Fully repaired Barrows items start out with no numbers in their names, e.g. Karil's leathertop. It will become Karil's leathertop 100 the first time it's used in combat. Eventually it will degrade to Karil's leathertop 75, then 50, then 25 and finally 0 at which point the armour will be unusable until repaired. Additionally, Barrows equipment may only be traded if fully repaired or fully degraded. When dropped or lost on death, any piece of Barrows equipment will automatically degrade to 0. Players who attempt to drop Barrows equipment will receive a warning message about this. There are two ways to repair Barrows armour. Players can talk to any of the NPCs listed below and they will repair the items for a price, or repair the pieces themselves using an rsrc804 in any rsrc156. The equipment can be repaired at any stage, and the cost will be adjusted according to how much it has degraded. The repair costs below are as if the equipment has fully degraded. The following NPCs can repair the armour:  Karil's leathertop loosely resembles a rsrc1604.",

The player must wear the robes in order to enter the rsrc1184 farther north along the rsrc1182. After the quest, players may use the robes to continue to access the dungeon, although few do. You can get a new set of robes by searching the cupboard again for the torn robes and then remaking them with needle and thread. You cannot get another set of torn robes if you already have a set of torn robes or robe of Elidnis in your possession (including in the bank). However, you can use the rsrc1731 to get extra sets by dropping your robes before searching the cupboard. This gets you a new set of torn robes, which you can mend when you wish. Some players believe that the Robes of Elidinis provide better protection from rsrc2708 than rsrc5299 does. However, the Robes of Elidinis actually provide no protection from desert heat at all.  ",

To wear Torag's platebody, a player must have 70 rsrc30. Being part of Torag's barrows set, if Torag's platebody is worn along with all of the other pieces of equipment in the set, the player gains a special attack. Damaging melee attacks have a chance of lowering the victim's rsrc15971 by 20%. This piece of armour cannot be made using the rsrc74 rsrc15940. * - Torag's platebody is only tradeable when undamaged or fully broken.  Barrows equipment rsrc16152 as it is used. Equipment received from the Barrows minigame is fully repaired and can be used for 15 hours of combat until it degrades completely and requires repair before it can be used again. Barrows armour degrades even if the player is using protection prayers or not taking damage. Unlike the rsrc802 and rsrc794, Barrows equipment does not suffer in performance as it degrades from fully repaired to fully degraded. Fully repaired Barrows items start out with no numbers in their names, e.g. Torag's platebody. It will become Torag's platebody 100 the first time it's used in combat. Eventually it will degrade to Torag's platebody 75, then 50, then 25 and finally 0 at which point the armour will be unusable until repaired. Additionally, Barrows equipment may only be traded if fully repaired or fully degraded. When dropped or lost on death, any piece of Barrows equipment will automatically degrade to 0. Players who attempt to drop Barrows equipment will receive a warning message about this. There are two ways to repair Barrows armour. Players can talk to any of the NPCs listed below and they will repair the items for a price, or repair the pieces themselves using an rsrc804 in any rsrc156. The equipment can be repaired at any stage, and the cost will be adjusted according to how much it has degraded. The repair costs below are as if the equipment has fully degraded. The following NPCs can repair the armour: Enter your smithing level here to calculate how much it would cost to repair the Torag's platebody on an rsrc804: ",

To wear Verac's brassard, a player must have 70 rsrc30. Like all rsrc807, Verac's brassard cannot be made using the rsrc74 skill. If Verac's brassard is worn with all other parts of rsrc16305, there is a chance that successful attacks will hit through an opponent's rsrc30 and rsrc81. This ability can be used to cause high amounts of damage. Verac's brassard is only tradeable when either undamaged or fully broken. Dropping this item in un-noted form it will instantly degrade it to \"0\". Verac's brassard offers significantly less rsrc507 and rsrc78 protection than rsrc6817, rsrc7282 and rsrc5313 platebodies (which all have equal stats). Because of this, Verac's brassard is rarely seen being used outside of the full set, because it incurs the same repair cost as the Barrows platebodies. However, Verac's brassard does not penalise ranged and rsrc59 attack bonuses nearly as much as regular melee armour.  Barrows equipment rsrc16152 as it is used. Equipment received from the Barrows minigame is fully repaired and can be used for 15 hours of combat until it degrades completely and requires repair before it can be used again. Barrows armour degrades even if the player is using protection prayers or not taking damage. Unlike the rsrc802 and rsrc794, Barrows equipment does not suffer in performance as it degrades from fully repaired to fully degraded. Fully repaired Barrows items start out with no numbers in their names, e.g. Verac's brassard. It will become Verac's brassard 100 the first time it's used in combat. Eventually it will degrade to Verac's brassard 75, then 50, then 25 and finally 0 at which point the armour will be unusable until repaired. Additionally, Barrows equipment may only be traded if fully repaired or fully degraded. When dropped or lost on death, any piece of Barrows equipment will automatically degrade to 0. Players who attempt to drop Barrows equipment will receive a warning message about this. There are two ways to repair Barrows armour. Players can talk to any of the NPCs listed below and they will repair the items for a price, or repair the pieces themselves using an rsrc804 in any rsrc156. The equipment can be repaired at any stage, and the cost will be adjusted according to how much it has degraded. The repair costs below are as if the equipment has fully degraded. The following NPCs can repair the armour: Enter your smithing level here to calculate how much it would cost to repair the Verac's brassard on an rsrc804: ",

    "article-text": "Bandos boots are part of the rsrc2103 set, which requires 65 rsrc30 to wear. They have the second highest ranged defence bonus for boots (beaten by its upgraded variant, the rsrc2107), and are one of the few pairs of boots that have a rsrc81 bonus, among rsrc2108, rsrc2110, rsrc2101, and rsrc2107. Bandos boots are dropped by rsrc719 and his bodyguards in the rsrc467. There is also an extremely low chance that they can be dropped by rsrc1715 and rsrc1716 when doing rsrc92 coordinates. Bandos boots can be combined with a rsrc2105 to create a pair of rsrc2107, which have increased stats. The process cannot be reversed.  Bandos boots are often considered the \"odd one out\" of the Bandos armour set as they emphasise defensive bonuses, unlike the rsrc2102 and rsrc102 which sacrifice melee defence (albeit a small amount) to give Strength bonus while the boots do not. This is the reason why most players, even while wearing Bandos armour, will usually opt for a different pair of boots in order to maximise their strength bonus. As a result, Bandos boots are significantly cheaper than the rest of the armour, despite being equally rare, due to their lack of demand. However, their high ranged defence bonus makes them desirable for players trying to maximise their defensive bonuses. They are occasionally seen being used by rsrc16317 due to their low cost and substantial defence bonus. Furthermore, they are effective when combined with the rest of the Bandos armour when trying to achieve an extremely high ranged defence bonus. They are commonly used for protection against Bandos followers; wearing these boots will render followers of rsrc1273 unaggressive to the wearer in the God Wars Dungeon. This makes them a good option for players hunting General Graardor, as they have the added benefit of prayer bonus and good tanking performance. It should be noted that Bandos boots are, along with their successor rsrc2107, several times heavier than any other pair of boots in the game, with a weight of 6kg. This makes them impractical for travel and dangerous skilling activities such as rsrc2109 or rsrc16318. Bandos boots are also used for the rsrc91 level emote clue at rsrc2098, together with a rsrc2097 and an rsrc2099.  On the 16th of April 2014 it was polled that a +20 ranged defence bonus be added to Bandos boots, and this poll failed by only 33 votes, getting 74.8% yes votes instead of the 75% needed. It was re-polled with a +15 ranged defence bonus instead, and passed. Bandos boots are one of the very few pairs of boots to provide any ranged defence in rsrc1469. \"Full Bandos\" commonly refers to the Bandos chestplate and Bandos tassets and not the boots, as the boots' lack of strength bonus makes them undesirable for many activities.",

The boots can be taken regardless of your rsrc1729 progress; you do not need to start the quest to obtain the boots of lightness. The respawn time for the boots is approximately 52 seconds. Players can hop between worlds to quickly obtain multiple pairs. Should players lose the boots they can return to the Temple of Ikov or purchase another pair from rsrc465 for 9,800 coins.  ",

They are the predominantly defensive counterpart to rsrc5321, providing the best melee and ranged defence bonuses of any footwear. They can be created by using a rsrc2105 with a pair of rsrc2096. When a player does this, a message in the chatbox will state The second you hold your tourmaline core by the Bandos boots, the core is absorbed rapidly. Perhaps there is some link between the metal in Bandos and tourmaline... Like the Bandos boots used in their creation, they will render followers of rsrc1273 rsrc16323 to the wearer in the rsrc467. The high ranged defence bonus of Guardian boots makes them even more desirable than regular rsrc2096 for players trying to maximise their defensive bonuses. Furthermore, they are effective when combined with the rest of the Bandos armour when trying to achieve an extremely high ranged defence bonus. It should be noted that Guardian boots are, along with their predecessor rsrc2096, several times heavier than any other pair of boots in the game, with a weight of 6kg. This makes them impractical for travel and dangerous skilling activities such as rsrc2109 or rsrc16318.  Guardian boots do not penalise ranged and magic attack bonuses as much as the original Bandos boots.",

When wearing the sandals the player can see his/her feet, however when no boots are equipped the player is always wearing shoes.",

Adamant bolts can be smithed at level 73 rsrc74 using an rsrc369, creating 10 rsrc416 per bar. Level 61 rsrc316 is required to complete the bolts. When adding rsrc412, each ten bolts yields 70 experience. Players can also choose to attach rsrc413 at 65 Fletching or rsrc411 at 63 Fletching and enchant the bolts for added effects in combat. They are an uncommon drop from rsrc365, a useful source for rsrc16104 who lack the 73 smithing. As described above they can then be made in rsrc414, useful for boss fights. A player with 55 rsrc285 and 61 Ranged may wish to instead use rsrc409, as these are equally strong, yet are considerably cheaper. However, broad bolts cannot be fired by an rsrc415 and require a rsrc407 or higher to use. Because these bolts are often used for enchanted bolts, their price is often higher than rsrc408. Before using adamant bolts for ranging, consider using runite instead.  ",

    "article-text": "Broad bolts (or Broad-tipped bolts) are bolts used for a rsrc3167. They are the broad-tipped equivalent of rsrc406 (+100 rsrc469). Players can buy 250 of them by exchanging 35 rsrc293 or buy up to 5,000 unfinished broad bolts at a time (or buy rsrc3538) directly from any rsrc16096. Broad bolts, or their rsrc976, are required by players who intend to slay rsrc975 or rsrc16342 using rsrc78. They can be player made using the rsrc316 skill of at least level 55 by adding rsrc16349 to rsrc3539 after purchasing the ability to fletch them for 300 Slayer reward points. rsrc3539 can be purchased from Slayer Masters with coins. It is generally better to buy broad bolts from the rsrc490 as they cost only a few GP more than fletching them, and to instead spend Slayer reward points on the ability to craft the rsrc282 (400 points) or rsrc3540 (300 points), as these items are far more useful for the amount of Slayer reward points spent. Broad bolts are fletched 10 at a time and give 3 Fletching experience per bolt, or 30 experience per set of 10 bolts made. Broad bolts are only usable by players with a rsrc285 level of at least 55 and a Ranged level of at least 61. They can be fired only by the rsrc407, rsrc977, rsrc978 and rsrc974. Many players use broad bolts for training and general ranging because they are as strong as rsrc406, but are significantly cheaper.  ",

An unlimited supply of mith grapples can be found via a crate located in rsrc16368, due south of the grapple spot. However, the player requires a mith grapple to access the Eyrie.

Attaching feathers to each bolt requires a rsrc316 level of 54 and 1 feather, granting 5 Fletching experience per bolt. Mithril bolts may be tipped with rsrc1111, rsrc3883, or a rsrc16000. To tip the bolts with sapphire, a player must have a Fletching level of 56 and use rsrc7978 with the mithril bolts, granting 4.7 Fletching experience for each sapphire bolt tip attached and making the mithril bolts into rsrc7977. To tip the bolts with emerald, a player must have a Fletching level of 58 and use rsrc5781 with the mithril bolts, granting 5.5 Fletching experience for each emerald bolt tip attached and making the mithril bolts into rsrc5783. To tip a bolt with a grapple, a player must use a mithril grapple tip on the mithril bolt, granting 11 Fletching experience, and also a rsrc1609, making a rsrc16000.

This will deal 20% extra damage and heal the attacker's rsrc65 by 25% of the total damage dealt. This does not work on the undead, as they have no \"life\" to leech.

The spell enchants 10 ruby bolts at a time and uses 1 rsrc1137, 1 rsrc1136, and 5 rsrc839. Enchanted ruby bolts have a chance of activating the Blood Forfeit effect. When activated, damage dealt to the target will be 20% of the opponent's current rsrc65 with a cap of 100 damage rsrc274 and at the cost of 10% of the player's current Hitpoints. The effect does not activate if the player cannot spare the hitpoints below 10. A long, shrieking noise can be heard when this activates. For low hitpoint opponents, this effect can be disadvantageous because the effect overrides bolts damage (Example bolt activates against 99 hp opponent. Damage dealt will be only 19 when without activating you could be hitting 50). This enchantment is especially effective against opponents with a high number of Hitpoints, such as rsrc553. These bolts are most often used in rsrc1708-hunting, commonly against rsrc467 bosses such as rsrc1660 and rsrc606. The special effect has a 11% chance of activating in PvP and a 6% of activating in PvM. If the player has completed the rsrc16376 then these values increase to 12.1% and 6.6% respectively.

    "article-text": "Ruby dragon bolts (e) are rsrc9046 that are enchanted via the rsrc2993 spell by a player with level 49 rsrc59. The spell enchants 10 bolts per cast, and uses 1 rsrc1136, 1 rsrc1137, and 5 rsrc839. Enchanted ruby dragon bolts have a chance of triggering the Blood Forfeit effect. This will remove 20% of the opponent's current rsrc65 (Capped at 100 damage)rsrc274 but at the cost of 10% of the player's current Hitpoints. It does not work if the player cannot spare the Hitpoints. A long, shrieking noise can be heard when this activates. For low hitpoint opponent's effect can be disadvantageous because the effect overrides bolts damage (Example bolt activates against 99 hp opponent. Damage dealt will be only 19 when without activating you could be hitting 50). This enchantment is especially effective against opponents with a high number of Hitpoints, such as rsrc553. These bolts are most often used in rsrc1708-hunting, commonly against rsrc467 bosses such as rsrc1660 and rsrc606. The special effect has a 11% chance of activating in PvP and a 6% of activating in PvM. If the player has completed the Hard Kandarin Diary then these values increase to 12.1% and 6.6% respectively. The Kandarin Diary boost is always active regardless of whether the headgear is equipped.rsrc2761  ",

To wear Ahrim's robe skirt, a player must have 70 rsrc30 and 70 rsrc59. If the robe skirt is worn along with all of the other pieces of equipment in Ahrim's set, a passive effect will be activated: successful rsrc59 attacks will have a chance of temporarily lowering the opponent's rsrc64 level. This piece of armour cannot be made using the rsrc74 or rsrc263 rsrc58.  Barrows equipment rsrc16152 as it is used. Equipment received from the Barrows minigame is fully repaired and can be used for 15 hours of combat until it degrades completely and requires repair before it can be used again. Barrows armour degrades even if the player is using protection prayers or not taking damage. Unlike the rsrc802 and rsrc794, Barrows equipment does not suffer in performance as it degrades from fully repaired to fully degraded. Fully repaired Barrows items start out with no numbers in their names, e.g. Ahrim's robeskirt. It will become Ahrim's robeskirt 100 the first time it's used in combat. Eventually it will degrade to Ahrim's robeskirt 75, then 50, then 25 and finally 0 at which point the armour will be unusable until repaired. Additionally, Barrows equipment may only be traded if fully repaired or fully degraded. When dropped or lost on death, any piece of Barrows equipment will automatically degrade to 0. Players who attempt to drop Barrows equipment will receive a warning message about this. There are two ways to repair Barrows armour. Players can talk to any of the NPCs listed below and they will repair the items for a price, or repair the pieces themselves using an rsrc804 in any rsrc156. The equipment can be repaired at any stage, and the cost will be adjusted according to how much it has degraded. The repair costs below are as if the equipment has fully degraded. The following NPCs can repair the armour:   Ahrim's robeskirt is unusually heavy compared to other magic legwear; it is second only to rsrc6631 as the heaviest legwear in the game.",

Bandos tassets are widely coveted among melee users as they provide a strength bonus along with substantial defensive bonuses.  Bandos armour is arguably the most powerful non-degradable melee armour in Old School RuneScape, and bandos tassets have the highest offensive stats of any melee rsrc2147 item. For this reason, it is a common selection for rsrc2114, rsrc16273, and other prolonged combat encounters. Its excellent ranged protection along with its strength and prayer bonus makes it popular for some boss hunting scenarios. Stat-wise, it is comparable to rsrc807, which provide almost identical ranged protection and significantly higher melee protection. However, most barrows armour does not provide any strength or prayer bonus and degrades. The most comparable piece of barrows armour is rsrc2149; its +4 prayer bonus, higher melee defensive bonuses and lack of negative magic defence bonus makes it a very feasible substitute given its lower cost. In comparison to other non-degradable options, rsrc2150 have 1 less strength bonus and 25 less stab defence, 20 less slash defence, 25 less crush defence, and 53 less ranged defence, but are significantly cheaper. rsrc2148 are also much cheaper and offer similar melee protection with 3 less stab defence, 3 more slash defence, 3 less crush defence, and 28 less ranged defence and no strength bonus.

Dharoks requires level 70 rsrc30 to wear. This armour, when worn in a set, will increase the damage a player is able to deal, allowing for extremely high hits. This effect occurs as the player's health lowers, meaning that the lower health the player has, the higher they are able to hit. It is the only item set with such an effect.  Barrows equipment rsrc16152 as it is used. Equipment received from the Barrows minigame is fully repaired and can be used for 15 hours of combat until it degrades completely and requires repair before it can be used again. Barrows armour degrades even if the player is using protection prayers or not taking damage. Unlike the rsrc802 and rsrc794, Barrows equipment does not suffer in performance as it degrades from fully repaired to fully degraded. Fully repaired Barrows items start out with no numbers in their names, e.g. Dharok's platelegs. It will become Dharok's platelegs 100 the first time it's used in combat. Eventually it will degrade to Dharok's platelegs 75, then 50, then 25 and finally 0 at which point the armour will be unusable until repaired. Additionally, Barrows equipment may only be traded if fully repaired or fully degraded. When dropped or lost on death, any piece of Barrows equipment will automatically degrade to 0. Players who attempt to drop Barrows equipment will receive a warning message about this. There are two ways to repair Barrows armour. Players can talk to any of the NPCs listed below and they will repair the items for a price, or repair the pieces themselves using an rsrc804 in any rsrc156. The equipment can be repaired at any stage, and the cost will be adjusted according to how much it has degraded. The repair costs below are as if the equipment has fully degraded. The following NPCs can repair the armour: Enter your smithing level here to calculate how much it would cost to repair the Dharok's platelegs on an rsrc804: ",

To equip Guthan's chainskirt, a player must have a rsrc30 level of 70. Being part of Guthan's barrows set, if Guthan's chainskirt is worn along with all of the other pieces of Guthan's set, the player receives its set effect: successful attacks have a chance of replenishing one rsrc16130 for each hitpoint of damage the player deals to an opponent. This piece of armour cannot be made using the rsrc74 rsrc15940. Despite Guthan's having more than average combat stats, it is mostly used by players to heal (and save space that would have been used by bringing rsrc184), after which they revert back to their regular melee armour. This method saves money and ultimately puts off having to repair the armour regularly.  Barrows equipment rsrc16152 as it is used. Equipment received from the Barrows minigame is fully repaired and can be used for 15 hours of combat until it degrades completely and requires repair before it can be used again. Barrows armour degrades even if the player is using protection prayers or not taking damage. Unlike the rsrc802 and rsrc794, Barrows equipment does not suffer in performance as it degrades from fully repaired to fully degraded. Fully repaired Barrows items start out with no numbers in their names, e.g. Guthan's chainskirt. It will become Guthan's chainskirt 100 the first time it's used in combat. Eventually it will degrade to Guthan's chainskirt 75, then 50, then 25 and finally 0 at which point the armour will be unusable until repaired. Additionally, Barrows equipment may only be traded if fully repaired or fully degraded. When dropped or lost on death, any piece of Barrows equipment will automatically degrade to 0. Players who attempt to drop Barrows equipment will receive a warning message about this. There are two ways to repair Barrows armour. Players can talk to any of the NPCs listed below and they will repair the items for a price, or repair the pieces themselves using an rsrc804 in any rsrc156. The equipment can be repaired at any stage, and the cost will be adjusted according to how much it has degraded. The repair costs below are as if the equipment has fully degraded. The following NPCs can repair the armour: Enter your smithing level here to calculate how much it would cost to repair the Guthan's chainskirt on an rsrc804: Prior to a rsrc16285, the chain section of Guthan's chainskirt was translucent when worn by male characters.",

To wear Karil's leatherskirt, a player must have 70 rsrc30 and 70 rsrc78. Karil's leatherskirt gives the second highest rsrc15950 for the legs, second only to the rsrc1653's +40. Being part of Karil's barrows set, if Karil's skirt is worn along with all of the other pieces of equipment in Karil's barrows set the player gains a special effect. On successful attacks with rsrc1677 against a player, there is a chance that it may temporarily lower that player's rsrc505 level. This piece of armour cannot be made using the rsrc263 rsrc15940.  Barrows equipment rsrc16152 as it is used. Equipment received from the Barrows minigame is fully repaired and can be used for 15 hours of combat until it degrades completely and requires repair before it can be used again. Barrows armour degrades even if the player is using protection prayers or not taking damage. Unlike the rsrc802 and rsrc794, Barrows equipment does not suffer in performance as it degrades from fully repaired to fully degraded. Fully repaired Barrows items start out with no numbers in their names, e.g. Karil's leatherskirt. It will become Karil's leatherskirt 100 the first time it's used in combat. Eventually it will degrade to Karil's leatherskirt 75, then 50, then 25 and finally 0 at which point the armour will be unusable until repaired. Additionally, Barrows equipment may only be traded if fully repaired or fully degraded. When dropped or lost on death, any piece of Barrows equipment will automatically degrade to 0. Players who attempt to drop Barrows equipment will receive a warning message about this. There are two ways to repair Barrows armour. Players can talk to any of the NPCs listed below and they will repair the items for a price, or repair the pieces themselves using an rsrc804 in any rsrc156. The equipment can be repaired at any stage, and the cost will be adjusted according to how much it has degraded. The repair costs below are as if the equipment has fully degraded. The following NPCs can repair the armour:  ",

To obtain them, players must kill a level 11 rsrc3025 on the path to rsrc2613. However, the Mourner will bring all combat stats down to 20, so it is recommended players bring a rsrc16014 before fighting. When the player first obtains the trousers they are damaged and must be repaired. Players need to take 2 silks and a bear fur to rsrc3075, the Elven Seamstress in rsrc2017, to have the trousers repaired. Her excellent sewing ability requires just under 2 minutes for each set of trousers you wish to repair. If you already have a full mourner's set you can enter the Mourner's headquarters and go to the basement and kill a level 122 Mourner to get another Mourner's set, including a pair of trousers that will not need to be repaired. This, along with the rest of the mourner gear cannot be used to enter the incinerator area north of rsrc2248.  ",

Being part of Torag's barrows set, if Torag's platelegs is worn along with all of the other pieces of equipment in Torag's barrows set the player receives a special attack. Damaging melee attacks have a chance of lowering the target's rsrc15971 by 20%.

Equipment received from the Barrows minigame is fully repaired and can be used for 15 hours of combat until it degrades completely and requires repair before it can be used again. Barrows armour degrades even if the player is using protection prayers or not taking damage. Unlike the rsrc802 and rsrc794, Barrows equipment does not suffer in performance as it degrades from fully repaired to fully degraded. Fully repaired Barrows items start out with no numbers in their names, e.g. Torag's platelegs. It will become Torag's platelegs 100 the first time it's used in combat. Eventually it will degrade to Torag's platelegs 75, then 50, then 25 and finally 0 at which point the armour will be unusable until repaired. Additionally, Barrows equipment may only be traded if fully repaired or fully degraded. When dropped or lost on death, any piece of Barrows equipment will automatically degrade to 0. Players who attempt to drop Barrows equipment will receive a warning message about this. There are two ways to repair Barrows armour. Players can talk to any of the NPCs listed below and they will repair the items for a price, or repair the pieces themselves using an rsrc804 in any rsrc156. The equipment can be repaired at any stage, and the cost will be adjusted according to how much it has degraded. The repair costs below are as if the equipment has fully degraded.

To wear Verac's plateskirt, a player must have 70 rsrc30. Verac's plateskirt provides the same amount of melee protection as rsrc5314 and rsrc7286 with a marginally lower amount of rsrc78 protection. However, it does not penalise the wearer's rsrc15950, provides a substantial rsrc15902 (+4) and weighs less than most leg armour. Being part of Verac's barrows set, if Verac's plateskirt is worn along with all of the other pieces of equipment in Verac's barrows set the player receives a set effect: rsrc16210 have a chance of hitting through an opponent's rsrc30 and rsrc81, potentially causing heavy damage. This piece of armour cannot be made using the rsrc74 rsrc15940.  Barrows equipment rsrc16152 as it is used. Equipment received from the Barrows minigame is fully repaired and can be used for 15 hours of combat until it degrades completely and requires repair before it can be used again. Barrows armour degrades even if the player is using protection prayers or not taking damage. Unlike the rsrc802 and rsrc794, Barrows equipment does not suffer in performance as it degrades from fully repaired to fully degraded. Fully repaired Barrows items start out with no numbers in their names, e.g. Verac's plateskirt. It will become Verac's plateskirt 100 the first time it's used in combat. Eventually it will degrade to Verac's plateskirt 75, then 50, then 25 and finally 0 at which point the armour will be unusable until repaired. Additionally, Barrows equipment may only be traded if fully repaired or fully degraded. When dropped or lost on death, any piece of Barrows equipment will automatically degrade to 0. Players who attempt to drop Barrows equipment will receive a warning message about this. There are two ways to repair Barrows armour. Players can talk to any of the NPCs listed below and they will repair the items for a price, or repair the pieces themselves using an rsrc804 in any rsrc156. The equipment can be repaired at any stage, and the cost will be adjusted according to how much it has degraded. The repair costs below are as if the equipment has fully degraded. The following NPCs can repair the armour: Enter your smithing level here to calculate how much it would cost to repair the Verac's plateskirt on an rsrc804: When worn by a female character, it takes on a slightly different appearance and features shin guards.",

    "article-text": "The abyssal bludgeon is a two-handed rsrc16410 created by having rsrc254 combine three untradeable components \u2014 the rsrc243, rsrc249, and rsrc248. If the player already had the Overseer create one, they can use the three components on the rsrc251 it left behind. Level 70 rsrc28 and rsrc64 are required to equip this weapon. The components can be obtained from using the rsrc241, dropped by the rsrc242, on the rsrc16411. In terms of probability, it takes approximately 600 kills on average to get all three components. The bludgeon features a unique characteristic: regardless of which attack style is selected, only aggressive attacks are available, meaning it is only able to be used for rsrc64 training.  The abyssal bludgeon has a rsrc15915, Penance, which increases damage dealt by 0.5% for every rsrc16129 that the wielder is missing, consuming 50% of the wielder's special attack energy. The bludgeon has the same attack speed as the rsrc252, and although it does not match the strength bonus of a whip combined with a rsrc250, the bludgeon has the highest overall damage of any crush weapon, making it the superior option against monsters weak to crush, such as rsrc253 or rsrc246. The Abyssal bludgeon is considered to be the second best weapon to train Strength with, behind the more expensive rsrc245. It has superior damage per second of every other non-degradable weapon to feature an \"aggressive\" attack style, making it a common weapon choice for mid-wealth players. rsrc244 does possess a slightly higher Strength bonus than the bludgeon, but it is not cost-effective as it consumes rsrc247.  The process to create the weapon is similar to RuneScape 3's rsrc16412; both items require the player to obtain three untradeable pieces in order to create the said item. Even though the special attack creates bubbling pools which closely resemble an attack by the rsrc242 which can poison the player, the special attack will not. Upon release, the abyssal bludgeon's special attack did 0.3% damage per missing prayer point. This was buffed in rsrc16413 on 22 October rsrc240. The abyssal bludgeon weighed 0 kg, despite the components required to create it being 2 kg each (adding up to 6 kg). This was changed in rsrc15961 on 11 January rsrc231. The abyssal bludgeon weighed 0 kg, despite the components required to create it being 2 kg each (adding up to 6 kg). This was changed in rsrc15961 on 11 January rsrc231.",

Players can attach an rsrc1712, obtained from rsrc15927, to cosmetically enhance the godsword, creating an rsrc1713. This only alters its appearance, and gives no stat enhancements. It also becomes untradeable, returning both the godsword and the ornament kit.  Like all godswords, the Armadyl godsword has a rsrc15915, The Judgment. In addition to doubled accuracy, it inflicts damage with a 37.5% (125% multiplied by the hidden 110% every godsword special possesses, the calculation uses integer values after the multiplication of 1.1 the value gets rounded down and then multiplied by 1.25) higher maximum hit than a normal attack, consuming 50% of the player's special attack energy. The Judgment is capable of dealing a very large amount of damage; under ideal conditions, a player can potentially deal over 70 damage to a rsrc597 with the special attack, or just over 90 damage when utilizing the effects of a rsrc1710 or a rsrc1707. Because of this, the Armadyl godsword is very popular for most combat situations. In PvP scenarios the Armadyl godsword is most commonly used as a \"knock-out\" weapon, as the special is often capable of finishing an injured player in one large blow. In PvM scenarios its high hits are advantageous when fighting rsrc1708 monsters such as rsrc719, especially when several players are competing to deal the most damage in order to secure a drop.  The Armadyl godsword weighs 1kg more than the other godswords; this is due to the fact that the hilt is heavier.",

    "article-text": "The Bandos godsword is one of the four variants of the rsrc1709; the rsrc2128 is received from rsrc719 whilst the blade's shards are attainable from any other boss or boss minion in the rsrc467. As with all godsword variants, it requires level 75 rsrc28 to wield. Players can attach a rsrc2130, obtained from rsrc15927, to cosmetically enhance the godsword, creating a rsrc2132. This only alters its appearance, and gives no stat enhancements. It also becomes untradeable, returning both the godsword and the ornament kit.  The Bandos godsword's rsrc15915, Warstrike, has doubled accuracy, inflicts 21% more damage and drains the opponent's combat stats equivalent to the damage hit in the following order: rsrc30, rsrc64, rsrc81, rsrc28, rsrc59, rsrc78. Warstrike consumes 50% of the wielder's special attack energy. For example, if Warstrike inflicts 50 damage on a foe with 30 in all combat stats, it would drain 30 Defence and 20 Strength levels (leaving the target with 0 Defence and 10 Strength). Against rsrc2127, it drains his combat skills by 10 (following the stat drain order) if it fails to hit. The special attack is similar in effect to the rsrc2129, rsrc2131, rsrc2134, the rsrc2133, and rsrc1321. In PvP scenarios, devastating damage and stat reduction can be inflicted on other players simultaneously. Warstrike is especially devastating against rsrc16416 with little to no rsrc30 levels, as it can then significantly decrease their rsrc64, making it difficult to fight back. Moreover, any player lacking a rsrc1034 will continue to suffer the effects of the lost stats until they escape the PvP scenario or are killed. The victim's message box will state \"You feel drained!\" when Warstrike successfully hits in PvP combat. The special attack is also known to markedly reduce the difficulty of various rsrc1708 fights. Should the wielder hit high damage (35+) using Warstrike, the defence of the boss will be significantly decreased, allowing the rest of the fight to be easier, as more of the player's following attacks will hit. A basic yet effective strategy is to use Warstrike twice in quick succession; the second iteration of the attack is more likely to hit given its Defence reducing capabilities, and its stat-draining effect is cumulative. Alternatively, in a PvP scenario, Warstrike can be followed up using a higher-hitting special attack (i.e. rsrc1706) to finish off an opponent after reducing their Defence level. This special attack is more effective against NPC's and players relying on high defence bonuses rather than high defence levels, as losing defence levels quickly renders defence bonus redundant.  The Bandos godsword's special attack originally required 100% special attack energy. The special attack energy cost was changed to 65% after being polled, allowing the special attack to be much more viable. This was changed to 50% after another poll. The Bandos godsword was featured in the rsrc16417; it could be seen laying on a table in the most northwestern room of the event mansion. The Bandos godsword is featured in rsrc5789, a free-to-play quest based on the event. It can be picked up by players, but the room containing it is inaccessible.

The anchor can be repaired by rsrc2251 on the docks of rsrc2085. Note, rsrc2255 is needed to properly speak with Smith. Alternatively, players can purchase one from rsrc465 for 290,000 coins. The barrelchest anchor is mostly known as a PKing weapon, used in combos such as Anchor to Granite Maul specials. The reason why this particular combo is so effective is due to the fact that the Barrelchest Anchor has a delayed hit, allowing it to easily stack with the maul's two blows. If lost, it can be re-obtained by talking to the monk, rsrc2252, on rsrc2085 to receive another broken anchor which can once again be fixed by rsrc2251 for 230,000 coins. The rsrc2255 is required in order to communicate with Smith. The barrelchest anchor has a special attack, Sunder, which doubles the player's accuracy, increases max damage by 10%, and lowers the opponent's rsrc28, rsrc30, rsrc78, or rsrc59 level by 10% of the damage dealt. If the opponent's defence level is 1, it drains attack instead. This consumes 50% of the player's special attack energy. Sunder drains one rsrc16418 at a time by 10% of the damage dealt. Moves to next stat if stat that is being compared is <=1. Order Defence, Attack...rsrc274 ",

They can be found north-east of the rsrc2829. It is a 2-handed weapon that requires level 70 rsrc28, rsrc59 and rsrc78 to wield, and can be used to train all three. rsrc2828 is used as ammunition for the salamander. When using the Scorch (Slash) and Blaze (Magic) attack styles, the attack speed is 5. When using the Flare (Range) attack style, the attack speed is 6, which is similar in concept to the Rapid style of most ranged weapons.  Due to the nature of salamanders, combat experience is rewarded normally, only you will usually get less magic exp per attack because you aren't using rsrc884, there isn't a base exp amount per cast. For ranged mode the ranged strength bonus of the tar is used to decide the maximum hit. The black salamander uses harralander tars which have a ranged strength bonus of 49 (same as rsrc16339). For rsrc507 mode the strength bonus of the salamander is used, which is 71 (same as rsrc90). The maximum hit for magic mode uses the \"magic strength bonus\" of the salamander. This bonus is not visible in the equipment stats, but is equal to 92 for the black salamander. The max hit formula for salamanders is: floor(0.5 + Magic*(64 + Bonus)/640), where \"Magic\" is your visible magic level (the level shown in the stats tab) and \"Bonus\" is the \"magic strength bonus\" for the salamander, in this case 92. This gives us the following formula for the black salamander, where \"Magic\" is your visible magic level: Specific boosts can increase maximum hits. The table below shows maximum hits from level 70 to level 109. It offers high hits especially for magic, however it may not be as useful as using other weapons, such as a rsrc1354, due to the lack of magic attack bonus and its attack distance of 1 square (although it can attack diagonally, unlike most melee weapons). This can be a problem at rsrc797 due to the brothers' powerful melee attacks.  It is possible to use this item to attack rsrc686, including rsrc1660, using melee, which cannot be done using regular melee weapons.",

Craw's bow is a rsrc1686 once owned by Craw, one of the more formidable followers among rsrc1664's forces during the rsrc1224. It can be received as a drop from rsrc1008 found within the rsrc1019.

When Craw's bow is charged with rsrc3478, an additional 50% ranged accuracy and damage boost is applied when attacking any rsrc15930 in the rsrc464, consuming 1 ether per attack whether the player hits or not. This effect will stack with a rsrc282 or a rsrc1086 and their variants, but not both simultaneously. This makes it the strongest ranged weapon in the Wilderness, surpassing the damage output of a rsrc1695 with rsrc1674. In order to use the bow's passive effect, it must first be activated with 1,000 rsrc3478 (costing 102,000). The 1,000 ether used to activate the bow does not count towards the usage of the passive effect, thus additional ether must be added (up to 16,000) in order to increase the bow's damage output. The ether can be safely removed by selecting the right-click Uncharge option on the bow, after which the bow becomes tradeable again. Upon death within the Wilderness, any revenant ether stored within the bow will always be lost, even if it is one of the player's protected items. Because of this, despite the bow being able to store a maximum of 17,000 revenant ether, it is recommended to store the minimum amount required for a trip into the Wilderness (in addition to the 1,000 ether required to activate the weapon).  The name of the weapon is an oronym to the rsrc16425 weapon type. Upon release, Craw's bow had a starting rsrc490 price of 10,000,000 coins. This was manually adjusted to 100,000,000 coins on 1 August after frequent rsrc14113 in the Wilderness via dropping items whose prices on the Grand Exchange were more than the bow itself. As the game prioritises the protection of items that have the highest price on the Grand Exchange, the player may end up losing the bow by picking up an item worth slightly more than the bow on the Grand Exchange, which was worth around 360 million coins at the time.",

    "article-text": "The crystal bow is a rsrc4990 rsrc972 made from enchanted rsrc16426 rsrc4991. It requires the completion of rsrc165 to wield, as well as 50 rsrc505 and 70 rsrc78. Along with the rsrc802, rsrc4995 and the rsrc1099, it is one of the four pieces of rsrc4988 in rsrc15920. A crystal bow is created when an elf sings to a rsrc4997 and enchants it into a bow. The most prominent elf with this talent is rsrc4996, who will perform this service for players for a price. Because it is blessed by the elven goddess rsrc4992, the crystal bow does not require any rsrc1685 to use, as it generates its own when fired. The bow's fired shots are coated in a green aura, similar to rsrc4946. Along with being extremely accurate when fully charged, providing a Ranged bonus of +100, the crystal bow also has one of the longest ranges in the game, the same as a longbow, able to hit targets up to 10 squares away. However, Longrange does not increase attack range. This makes it ideal for battles which require long-range attacks such as rsrc1475 or the rsrc4994. The only attack which can be performed from a further distance is the rsrc1394 special attack, with a range of 13 squares. Unlike other bows, the Crystal bow has a unique attack speed of 5, which is between that of a shortbow and a longbow in speed. It is faster than a crossbow by 1 rsrc16427.  The crystal bow degrades over time. After 250 hits, it degrades into a \"Crystal bow 9/10\", and thereafter for every 250 hits, it will degrade another 1/10th until it reverts into a rsrc4997 after a total of 2,500 hits, and must be recharged before it can be used again. As the bow degrades, its rsrc4998 and rsrc4989 bonuses decrease as shown below. The crystal bow can be imbued for 2,000 rsrc238 points per charge, requiring 20,000 points to imbue a fully charged bow. Imbuing the crystal bow does not keep it from degrading, however its stats will remain at their maximum, regardless of how much it has degraded. When the bow reverts back to a crystal seed, it will lose its imbue, and players must imbue it again using points from the Nightmare Zone. Additionally, imbuing a crystal bow that has already degraded to 9/10 or below will restore the bow's stats to their maximum. rsrc4996 will recharge rsrc4997 into crystal bows, rsrc4995, or rsrc802. She can be found teleporting back and forth between two clearings in rsrc2366. Initially, Ilfeen charges 900,000 coins to re-enchant a crystal seed into a crystal bow. However, the price is decreased by 180,000 coins each time Ilfeen re-enchants a seed for a player, in the following manner, until reaching the minimum recharge cost of 180,000 coins: The amount that Ilfeen charges is dependent on the number of crystal seeds she has re-enchanted, not the number of crystal bows she has recharged. For example, a player who pays Ilfeen 900,000 coins to re-enchant a crystal seed into a rsrc802 will only have to pay her 720,000 coins to recharge a seed into a crystal bow. A crystal bow with 2/10 charges is a possible reward for completion of rsrc165. (Players who choose a rsrc802 can choose to let the shield revert into a seed, then re-enchant that seed into a crystal bow.) Additionally, players can buy new crystal bows from rsrc4993 for 900,000 coins each. Unlike Ilfeen's recharge price, the price of a new crystal bow does not decrease. The distinction between a new crystal bow and a full crystal bow is important, as only new crystal bows are tradeable. A crystal bow that is bought from Islwyn is new; a crystal seed that is re-enchanted into a crystal bow by Ilfeen is full. Once a shot is fired from a new crystal bow, it becomes a full crystal bow, and is untradeable. As crystal seeds are tradeable, players can buy them from other players and pay Ilfeen to re-enchant them into crystal bows. Although crystal bows do not require any ammunition, they still have a cost associated with their use, in the form of their recharge cost. When the recharge price is 900,000 coins, the cost per shot (at 2,500 shots) is 360 coins. However, when the recharge price decreases to 180,000 coins, the cost per shot is 72 coins. Compare this to rsrc969, with a +49 bonus to rsrc469, whereas the crystal bow, on average, has a Ranged Strength of +61. The chief disadvantages that crystal bows have, compared to other bows, are the requirements for using them and the relatively short degrading time. Crystal equipment has the second shortest lifespan of any equipment in the game (ahead of rsrc1352). One crystal bow will last for 1 hour and 40 minutes of continuous shooting on Rapid, or 2 hours and 5 minutes on Accurate or Long range. Players who plan to use crystal bows on extended trips may wish to bring more than one bow. Additionally, players who would normally pick up their ammunition (either manually or through an rsrc3213) may not save money by using a crystal bow, which requires no ammunition and therefore leaves behind no arrows to pick up. 55 rsrc78 (rsrc1683)  65 rsrc78 (rsrc1690) +70 (rsrc1683)  +80 (rsrc1690)   The number of shots fired by crystal bows is tracked per player rather than per bow, making it possible to prevent a fully charged bow from degrading by using another crystal bow for every 250th shot. Attempting to cast rsrc4 or rsrc8 on a crystal bow results in the message \"You can't do that to elven crystal!\" This is due to a rsrc14775 that allowed players to alchemise crystal bows on rsrc375 worlds for 540,000 coins each. Players could buy crystal seeds, enchant them into bows for 180,000 coins, and alchemise the bows for significant profit. Because of this, Jagex made it impossible to alchemise members' objects on free-to-play worlds, and made it impossible to alchemise crystal equipment. The crystal bow requires 50 Agility to equip, however it is impossible to navigate the forests of rsrc4548 during the required quests without level 56 Agility (or as low as 51 with a rsrc4581 boost). 10 tiles is the maximum distance for any attack in 'RuneScape'. The Crystal bow's attack range on Accurate and Rapid is 10, therefore Long Range can have no effect on this.",

    "article-text": "The crystal halberd is a rsrc4990 two-handed rsrc16421 made from rsrc16426 rsrc4991. It requires completion of rsrc5000 to wield, as well as 70 rsrc28, 35 rsrc64 and 50 rsrc505. In order to obtain a crystal halberd, one must talk to rsrc4993 who will offer to sell you a \"new\" crystal halberd for 750,000 coins. Alternatively, one can take a rsrc4997 to rsrc4996 to be recharged at a discounted price into a \"full\" crystal halberd. The crystal halberd is significantly more powerful than a rsrc5001, making it a good choice as a melee rsrc16428 weapon. The crystal halberd is frequently used for its special attack, which can deal high damage against large enemies. It also works on the rsrc682 and is unaffected by the non-spear weapon damage penalty, as halberds are classified as spears when used against the corporeal beast. While bested by the special attacks of the rsrc278 and rsrc4999 against other monsters, the crystal halberd is still popular for this purpose.  The Crystal halberd shares the same rsrc15915 as the rsrc5001, consuming 30% of the player's special attack energy. In addition to a 10% damage boost, if used against \"large\" monsters (anything that is larger than 1x1, such as rsrc719), the special attack will deal an additional second hit onto them, although with 25% reduced accuracy. It can also hit 10 enemies in a multi-combat area in a 3x1 area centred on the main target. The crystal halberd's special attack's accuracy rolls against the opponent's slash defence.rsrc274 When using gear with the highest strength bonus and a rsrc282 or rsrc1710 on task, the highest possible hit with the special attack is 71\u201371 (total of 142) on large monsters. While this is higher than what rsrc4999 and rsrc278 can achieve, the much slower attack speed of the halberd is a major downside, so the claws and dagger generally lead to faster damage output in combat. The special attack's ability to hit up to 10 enemies can prove more useful; when on a rsrc285 task where stacking enemies up in one pile to cast multi-combat spells is efficient, such as rsrc818, the Crystal halberd can deal a large amount of additional damage, often twice that of an rsrc2988. The crystal halberd degrades over time. After 250 hits, it degrades into a \"Crystal halberd 9/10\", and thereafter for every 250 hits, it will degrade another 1/10th, until it reverts into a rsrc4997 after a total of 2,500 hits, and must be recharged before it can be used again. If the special attack is used and it hits an opponent twice or multiple opponents, it will be considered one hit in regards to degradation. As the halberd degrades, the negative rsrc59 attack bonus and the defence bonuses remain the same while the positive attack bonuses decrease as shown below. The crystal halberd can be imbued for 2,000 rsrc238 points per charge, requiring 20,000 points to imbue a fully charged halberd. Imbuing the crystal halberd does not keep it from degrading, however its stats will remain at their maximum, regardless of how much it has degraded. When the halberd reverts back to a crystal seed, it will lose its imbue, and players must imbue it again using points from the Nightmare Zone. Additionally, imbuing a crystal halberd that has already degraded to 9/10 or below will restore the halberd's stats to their maximum. rsrc4996 will recharge rsrc4997 into rsrc794, rsrc802 or crystal halberds. She can be found teleporting back and forth between two clearings in rsrc2366. Initially, Ilfeen charges 750,000 coins to re-enchant a crystal seed into a crystal halberd. However, the price is decreased by 150,000 coins each time Ilfeen re-enchants a seed for a player, in the following manner, until reaching the minimum recharge cost of 150,000 coins: The amount that Ilfeen charges is dependent on the number of crystal seeds she has re-enchanted, not the number of crystal halberds she has recharged. For example, a player who pays Ilfeen 900,000 coins to re-enchant a crystal seed into a crystal bow will only have to pay her 600,000 coins to recharge a seed into a crystal halberd. It is one of the few pieces of equipment that requires three different skill levels to wield (rsrc505, rsrc28, rsrc64), as well as having several skill requirements, including rsrc173, to obtain from the rsrc5000. This makes it one of the most difficult to obtain weapons in the game. Upon release, the weapon was extremely bugged, rendering it almost useless. The combat interface displayed unarmed options (punch, kick, block). However, when you attacked an NPC or player, the message \"Unrecognised ranged weapon\" was displayed. This was fixed a week later. Previously, the right click uncharge option would give the message \"Nothing interesting happens.\" This option should enable the player to remove the weapon's imbued status, however it did not. This was fixed in an update on rsrc16429. The Crystal halberd did not originally have a special attack, this was later polled before adding into the game. Previously, the crystal halberd did not decrease in price when re-enchanting the crystal seed multiple times, requiring 750,000 coins for every new crystal halberd when buying one from Ilfeen. This was changed in an update on rsrc16222. The Crystal halberd's special attack used to only hit the main target on the central tile, but hit an unlimited amount of monsters on the two adjacent tiles. This was fixed in an update on rsrc16430, capping the maximum number of monsters to 10, but allowing monsters standing on the same tile as the primary target to also be affected by the attack.",

    "article-text": "The dark bow is a rsrc16432 that requires level 60 in rsrc78 to wield. It is only received as a drop from rsrc656. It is the slowest weapon in the game, with an attack speed of 1 (5.4 seconds). Its speed on rapid mode is 4.8 seconds. It shoots two arrows per attack. The dark bow has an rsrc76 of 10. Longrange does not increase attack range. Assuming that both weapons are set to the rsrc16433 attack style, the dark bow has a firing time of 2.4 seconds per arrow, whereas a shortbow such as the rsrc1689 takes only 1.8. Because of this, the dark bow is only fairly popular for rsrc518. It has the highest max hit of any weapons in the game by means of rsrc15915 (although rsrc1671 and rsrc2253 can hit harder with regular attacks and rsrc2097 is able to deal more total damage with its special attack).  10 tiles is the maximum distance for any attack in rsrc15920. The dark bow's attack range on Accurate and Rapid is 10, therefore Long Range can have no effect on this. The dark bow has a unique rsrc15915 comprised of two different attacks, both of which consume 55% of the player's special attack energy. The 1st special attack, Descent of Darkness, deals up to 30% more damage with a minimum of 5 damage per arrow. The Descent of Darkness special attack animation shows the arrow shafts surrounded in a black shroud being fired at the target. The 2nd special attack, Descent of Dragons, can only be used if the player has rsrc16340 equipped. This attack deals up to 50% more damage with a minimum of 8 damage per arrow, while capping the max hit at 48 damage per arrowrsrc274. The Descent of Dragons special attack animation shows rsrc553 heads being fired at the target. On 18 September 2014, dark bows could be recoloured using a special paint obtained from rsrc1241. The colouring will make the bow untradeable; however, to remove the colouring, simply use a rsrc304 and the bow will return to its regular state.

If players are wielding this axe with the rest of the set, they will be subject to a passive effect which increases their rsrc5316 as their rsrc65 are lowered. The highest possible hit with this weapon is 104 damage against living foes. Because of this, it is often used as a \"knock-out\" weapon in rsrc518 scenarios, as its high hits can easily finish off an injured player with one large blow. Dharok's greataxe currently has the fourth highest strength bonus of any rsrc358 in rsrc1469, beaten by the rsrc4995, the rsrc1709, and the rsrc5315. In order to be able to hit the maximum damage, the player needs to have one hitpoint remaining at a Hitpoints level of 99, drinking a rsrc5320 or an rsrc237 either from the rsrc238 or from rsrc1178, rsrc1266, and being equipped with rsrc2259, rsrc5321/rsrc5317, an rsrc1076/rsrc1080, an rsrc5318 and a rsrc2465.

Equipment received from the Barrows minigame is fully repaired and can be used for 15 hours of combat until it degrades completely and requires repair before it can be used again. Barrows armour degrades even if the player is using protection prayers or not taking damage. Unlike the rsrc802 and rsrc794, Barrows equipment does not suffer in performance as it degrades from fully repaired to fully degraded. Fully repaired Barrows items start out with no numbers in their names, e.g. Dharok's greataxe. It will become Dharok's greataxe 100 the first time it's used in combat. Eventually it will degrade to Dharok's greataxe 75, then 50, then 25 and finally 0 at which point the armour will be unusable until repaired. Additionally, Barrows equipment may only be traded if fully repaired or fully degraded. When dropped or lost on death, any piece of Barrows equipment will automatically degrade to 0. Players who attempt to drop Barrows equipment will receive a warning message about this. There are two ways to repair Barrows armour. Players can talk to any of the NPCs listed below and they will repair the items for a price, or repair the pieces themselves using an rsrc804 in any rsrc156. The equipment can be repaired at any stage, and the cost will be adjusted according to how much it has degraded. The repair costs below are as if the equipment has fully degraded.

    "article-text": "Dinh's bulwark is a two-handed shield created by rsrc5355, a rsrc16434 smith of unparalleled skill. It requires 75 rsrc28 and rsrc30 to wield and is obtained as a rare reward from the rsrc1178. It is the strongest shield in-game barring any effects (surpassing the rsrc1394 and its equivalents). As a two-handed shield, the bulwark is also capable of attacking opponents. In order to attack with the bulwark, it must be set to the pummel option. This also allows it to perform its special attack. While the block attack style is active, players lose the ability to attack but incoming damage is reduced by 20%. The damage reduction will not work in rsrc15952. In addition, there is an 8-tick (4.8 seconds) delay before the damage reduction applies when switching rsrc358 to prevent abuse by people equipping it on a defence tick and switching back to a damage-centric weapon for the attack tick. Furthermore, players wielding the bulwark will not be able to cast any combat spells; players attempting to do so will receive the message \"Your bulwark gets in the way.\".  Dinh's bulwark has a rsrc15915, Shield Bash, which hits up to 10 enemies in a 11x11 area around the player with 20% increased accuracy, consuming 50% of the player's special attack energy.  The rsrc15915 of Dinh's bulwark can be used to damage rsrc16359, which are normally impervious to rsrc507 attacks, if used on a nearby ground NPC. The shield's animation will play when the wielder fails to block an incoming attack. This can alert the wielder to heal as it occurs prior to the hit landing.",

Unlike most other dragon weapons, the dragon 2h sword requires no quest to wield. It can be obtained from most rsrc464 bosses, as well as the rsrc2464.  The dragon 2h sword has a rsrc15915, Powerstab, which consumes 60% of the player's special attack energy. When used in a multi-combat area, the attack hits all targets within 1 square of the player, including the one they are standing on; no more than 14 enemies can be hit at one time with this attack. However, there are no advantages when using this attack in a single-combat area. It can be especially useful while training in multi-combat areas, like those where one may fight rsrc4207 or rsrc16435. The attack is also useful in rsrc5403, when used in with the \"Power Surge\" power-up that gives the player temporary infinite special attacks. This allows the player to deal massive amounts of damage to many surrounding enemies at once, repeatedly. It also proves useful when playing rsrc5401, where multiple rsrc5402 may be found on a single space; using the special attack can distract the mass from healing the portal. Additionally, the sword has the same crush bonus as the rsrc16436 and rsrc1709, making it an effective crush weapon.  On release of rsrc1008, they could drop the dragon 2h sword. It was later removed from their drop table after an update.",

They are also temporarily obtainable from objects opened with rsrc3015 during a game of rsrc383. Dragon claws are notable for their special attack, which can deal a lot of damage in quick succession.  These claws feature a rsrc15915, Slice and Dice, which drains 50% of the special attack bar and hits an enemy four times in succession, which is popularly used by rsrc518 as a finisher. Rolls against opponents slash defence roll rsrc274. There are multiple possible sequences for the special attack. If the player is on a rsrc285 task (and using a rsrc282 or rsrc1710) wearing maximum strength gear, the highest possible hit sequence is 46\u201323\u201311\u201312, totalling up to 92. Against players, the highest sequence is 41\u201320\u201310\u201311, totalling up to 82. Although rsrc278 can hit higher (upwards of 100), its special attack rolls the two hits independently and it is less accurate, making high hits less consistent. Similarly, while rsrc4995 can also hit up to 142 in one special attack against a large monster, its slower attack speed and independent rolls make it perform worse on average. ",

In addition to a 10% damage boost, if used against \"large\" monsters (anything that is larger than 1x1, such as rsrc719), the special attack will deal an additional second hit onto them, although with 25% reduced accuracy.

    "article-text": "The dragon spear is a two-handed rsrc16414 that requires level 60 rsrc28 to wield. The dragon spear is one of few dragon items that does not require the completion of a quest to equip. This item is a rare drop from the rsrc550. Wearing a rsrc4309 will increase the chances of receiving one from the rare drop table. rsrc622 are more likely to drop the dragon spear than any other monster, with a drop rate of 1 in 512, and is the only monster to have it on its standard drop table. However it also has access to the rare drop table; as a result the chance of receiving a dragon spear is slightly more common than 1 in 512. rsrc559 may also drop this item at a reasonable rate. As with most rsrc5507, players cannot make this item using the rsrc74 skill. Like all poisonable weapons, dragon spears can be poisoned either with weapon poison or rsrc5524. The poison can be removed by using a rsrc304 on the poisoned spear. A dragon spear is also a requirement for two rsrc92.  The dragon spear has a rsrc15915, Shove, which it shares with the rsrc5525 and rsrc275. It pushes an opponent back and rsrc3080 them for three seconds, consuming 25% of the player's special attack energy. The effects of this special are non-stackable, meaning that players cannot use the spear's special attack on a target who is already stunned. In addition to this, players are given a one tick (0.6 seconds) period of immunity after a stun wears off in which they cannot be stunned again. Despite this, it is popular in player killing as the brief stun causes all incoming damage to be ignored until it dissipates, after which all damage taken is applied at once. In addition, it cannot be used against large monsters, such as giants, because they are too big to push back. If a player tries this, the special attack does not occur and no special attack energy is consumed. A message appears in the chat box, reading, \"That creature is too large to knock back!\" A general way to tell if the spear can use the \"Shove\" special attack is to determine how much space the target monster takes up. If it takes up more than one space, it cannot be shoved. For example, a player can shove an rsrc379, which takes up one space, but not an rsrc2489, which takes up four.  The Dragon spear's special attack was changed on 28 July 2016, due to many player complaints on how it was considered overpowered. Prior to the fix, large Wilderness clans could use the spear's special to \"stunlock\" the victim. The victim would be attacked by a group of players using rsrc10559, while another group would continually spam the special attack on the victim. The victim would be unable to perform any action, since they were being rsrc3080 and the game did not register the damage. Once the stuns stopped, the player would take all the damage they received while being stunned in one large tick, which would also drain them of all of their prayer. The only way for players to escape this was by x-logging, as the game would take them out of the server after a minute passed.",

It is carried on the shoulder with both hands. It uses dyed toads as ammo, which players make by filling rsrc2053 with any dye (except orange and purple), then using the bellows on a rsrc2054. Only one toad may be placed in the device at a time, and the device can only be wielded when filled with ammo. Its only attack modes are \"Aim and fire\", which the player uses to fire the toads at the sheep, and \"Kick\" which, as its name implies, is a basic kicking attack. If lost, players can re-obtain a rsrc3561 and ask the gnome prisoner to fix it. You will need more rsrc2152, rsrc3562 and another rsrc16438. He will still do this after the rsrc15898 is complete.  After Mourning's Ends Part I is complete, players can still use the Fixed device as usual, firing it at anyone and anything they wish. Players wishing to use this item for an extended amount of time can collect as many dyed toads as they want. It is also easier to use the device if a player has two of them: one to wield and one to keep in the inventory. This makes things easier because using a toad on the device in the player's inventory will also load the device on the player's shoulder, allowing it to be fired over and over without taking it off after each shot. The fixed device looks similar to a rsrc16439. This item gives no rsrc28 or rsrc30 bonuses, so it can be brought to rsrc1106. The rsrc5959 introduced in 2014 was a nod to this weapon's unique appearance. The Event RPG has since become a staple weapon among rsrc16440 due to its unique attack speed of 7, resulting in more damage per second than iron weaponry.",

    "article-text": "The godsword is a powerful rsrc361 that was released on 17 October, 2013, along with the rsrc467. Requiring 75 rsrc28 to wield, it carries the highest rsrc15936 bonus of any weapon. The godsword consists of a rsrc1711, to which a rsrc10620 is attached. There exists one hilt for each of four of RuneScape's gods: rsrc1664, rsrc1273, rsrc1222, and rsrc1220. Consequently, there are four different godswords: the rsrc1706, the rsrc2126, the rsrc9228, and the rsrc10459. All four godswords have identical stats, but each has a different rsrc15915, as detailed below. The godsword is created by smithing the three different rsrc13197 into a godsword blade at an rsrc438. Doing so requires 80 rsrc74, and gives a total of 200 Smithing experience. A godsword hilt is then attached to the godsword blade, which requires no stats and can be done by any player. Hilts can be attached or removed at will, at any time. Godsword hilts are dropped exclusively by the generals within the rsrc467 and godsword shards are dropped by their bodyguards. Somewhere near the end of the rsrc1224, during the rsrc1760, rsrc1220 had gathered armies so powerful that his victory seemed inevitable. In a last-ditch effort to oppose him, rsrc1222 formed an alliance with rsrc1664 and rsrc1273. They created the godsword, a weapon meant to ensure Zamorak's final defeat. A group of Armadyl's rsrc13195 was given the task of delivering the godsword to the army of Saradomin, which stood ready to do battle with Zamorak's forces. However, an aviantese had previously been captured by Zamorak's rangers, and it is believed that rsrc381 himself tortured the hapless aviansie for information. Having learned of the godsword's existence as well as its destination, Zamorak laid an ambush for the aviantese transporting the godsword. At the same time, he launched an attack against Saradomin's army with his own forces. Upon coming under attack, the aviantese carrying the godsword retreated into a temple beneath the mountains, and set up a defence against Zamorak's forces in an attempt to protect the godsword. Bandos and Saradomin sent portions of their armies into the temple as reinforcements for the aviantese, and for a time the three groups fought as allies against Zamorak's minions. However, as the battle wore on, old distrust between the forces of Armadyl, Bandos, and Saradomin resurfaced, and the forces of the three gods turned on one another, dissolving the alliance. The battle in the temple became a four-way free-for-all for control of the godsword; it is believed that during this great melee, the godsword was shattered into four pieces. It was then that Zamorak cast a mighty spell with such power that all of northern rsrc3096, much of rsrc1210's old territory, was destroyed, transforming the once-tranquil land into the desolate and hellish rsrc464. This spell also caused the entrance to the temple beneath the mountains to collapse, sealing the four armies inside. However, the struggle for the godsword continued. Before the battle could drag on any further, rsrc2168 awoke from his deep slumber. Furious at the ruin that the God Wars had wrought upon the world, he forced the four warring gods to cease their battles in Gielinor, and erected the rsrc13196 in order to prevent any further wars between gods in Gielinor. The temple and the armies within were frozen by a follower of Guthix, where they would remain undisturbed for thousands of years, their battle - and the godsword - long forgotten. However, during the Fifth Age, a combination of tectonic movements within the Wilderness and long rows of fires lit by adventurers thawed the dungeon and the armies within it. Unaware that the God Wars have ended, the followers of Armadyl, Bandos, Saradomin, and Zamorak continue to wage war for control of the godsword. Adventurers are now able to enter the dungeon for themselves and do battle with the armies within. Those who are powerful enough to defeat the mighty leaders can obtain the pieces of the godsword, and reconstruct it for themselves.  The godsword's rsrc15915 varies depending on which hilt is attached to the blade. All the special attacks will consume 50% of the player's special attack energy. Also they will double effective accuracy and increase effective strength by 10%. rsrc274 If a combat stat is drained to 1, remaining damage is used to drain another combat stat. They are drained in the following order: rsrc30, rsrc64, rsrc81, rsrc28, rsrc59, rsrc78. The special attack will not restore any prayer or hitpoints if it misses. The special attack will not freeze your opponent if it does not hit. The rsrc1706 is most effectively used in rsrc518 situations and against rsrc1708 monsters due to its high-hitting special attack, The Judgement, which is capable of inflicting enormous amounts of damage. Because of the sheer strength of its special attack, the Armadyl godsword is the most popular godsword, but not the most expensive one. rsrc719 is the most commonly killed general in the rsrc467 so there is a large supply of Bandos hilts, resulting in the rsrc2126 being the 2nd cheapest godsword. Its special attack, Warstrike, is often used against other players and powerful boss monsters. Most bosses have extremely high Defence and a large hit from Warstrike can make it significantly easier to kill them. It is especially dangerous against rsrc299 that have low Defence, as the special attack could potentially drain rsrc64 after draining Defence all the way down to 1. Warstrike previously used 65% of the player's special attack, however, this was reduced to 50% following the rsrc16442 The rsrc9228 is most effectively used in monster-killing situations, due to its helpful special attack. Healing Blade can be useful to players who are training rsrc285, doing the rsrc797 activity, or attempting the rsrc4994. Along with healing effects such as Guthan's set, the Saradomin godsword can act as a replacement for rsrc184. Its prayer restoration can also save players doses of rsrc1044. While the rsrc10459's special attack, Ice Cleave, is not particularly useful for general monster killing, it is very effective in a few special cases. One popular use of Ice Cleave is to freeze rsrc606, who has devastating melee and Magic attacks that she will use only at melee range. Additionally, Ice Cleave has a few uses during PvP situations, such as freezing players in place either to prevent their escape or to make it easier to escape them. Rangers and mages can also use Ice Cleave in lieu of rsrc8121 or equivalent to hold their target in place and attack them at a safe distance. During rsrc430, the Zamorak godsword can be used to freeze players who are carrying the flag, or players who are attempting to capture the flag. Additionally, as the godsword's freezing effect disables rsrc10524 on players, players can freeze their target, step away, attack once, then immediately step away again before their opponent can retaliate. This works even against faster weapons such as an rsrc252. Godswords attack slightly faster than other two-handed swords and similar weapons such as rsrc498. With an rsrc73 of 4, godswords attack at the same rate as rsrc3633. Although godswords are very strong, many players prefer to use weaker but faster weapons, such as rsrc252, rsrc639 and rsrc247, when training combat skills against low-Defence monsters, due to their higher damage-per-second rating than godswords. Nonetheless, godswords will generally deal more damage against high-Defence monsters than these weapons. The walking and running animations appear much smoother while having a godsword equipped. The same applies to the rsrc247, rsrc5525, rsrc2133, and a rsrc6564."

    "article-text": "The granite maul is a two-handed melee weapon that requires 50 rsrc64 and rsrc28 to wield. They are dropped by rsrc253 (75 rsrc285 required), which are in the rsrc2865. Players can use a rsrc6626, obtained from the rsrc303, to cosmetically enhance the granite maul, creating a rsrc6627. This only alters its appearance, and becomes untradeable. The clamp is effectively consumed by this process, as while the maul can be reverted, the clamp will not be retained.  The granite maul's rsrc1267, Quick Smash, consumes 50% of the player's special attack energy and deals an instant attack. This can result in two or three hits in a very short amount of time, making it a popular choice for rsrc518. If the three hits are timed correctly, the granite maul can kill instantly. However, one drawback is that unlike most special attacks, Quick Smash does not increase accuracy. It is commonly used in the rsrc238 in conjunction with the Power surge power-up. Because Quick Smash can be performed rapidly under the effect of Power surge, the granite maul is able to put out more total damage than other special attacks for as long as the power-up is active. Note: Initiating combat with the granite maul's special attack is wasteful as the player character will not deal an instant hit afterwards, with the regular delay occurring instead. Its inventory sprite resembles that of the rsrc6629. Prior to the debut of the rsrc490, this item's implication in scams was prevalent. Still, it is advisable to exercise caution when dealing with these items in the trade screen.",

Many players believe this is one of the most useful weapons in the game because its healing is ideal for combat rsrc212 and rsrc2114, reducing the need to bring rsrc184. Although Guthan's armour has relatively high combat stats and the spear is a feasible weapon, players often prefer to use it only when they need to heal, and switch to non-degradable melee armour afterwards.

While there is no actual defence requirement for the Heavy Ballista, completing the pre-requisite, Monkey Madness I, provides a minimum of 20,000 defence experience. This corresponds to an effective requirement of 33 defence. It is created by using rsrc2035 on a rsrc2040, then using the resulting rsrc2037 on a rsrc2043, and finally adding the rsrc5103 on an rsrc2044. The entire process requires level 72 in rsrc316, granting the player 660 experience. The speed on accurate is one tick slower than a godsword, but when put on rapid it matches the speed of a godsword. The ballista has an attack range of 9. Longrange increases attack range by 1.  The heavy ballista has a rsrc15915, Concentrated Shot, which it shares with the rsrc552. It performs an attack with 25% increased accuracy and damage.

It fires rsrc1672, which break upon firing. When equipped with the other three pieces of rsrc7330's set the wearer will receive the set effect , which has a chance to temporarily lower their target's rsrc505 level. This effect is negligible against NPC's. This weapon cannot be made using the rsrc74 rsrc15940. Unlike standard crossbows; it is wielded in both hands. Furthermore, regular crossbows fire fewer, more powerful shots, meaning Karil's crossbow is actually similar in function to a rsrc71; this gives it a potentially higher damage per second, at the expense of the shield slot. The crossbow has an attack range of 8. Longrange increases attack range by 2.  55 rsrc78 (rsrc1683)  65 rsrc78 (rsrc1690) +70 (rsrc1683)  +80 (rsrc1690)  Barrows equipment rsrc16152 as it is used. Equipment received from the Barrows minigame is fully repaired and can be used for 15 hours of combat until it degrades completely and requires repair before it can be used again. Barrows armour degrades even if the player is using protection prayers or not taking damage. Unlike the rsrc802 and rsrc794, Barrows equipment does not suffer in performance as it degrades from fully repaired to fully degraded. Fully repaired Barrows items start out with no numbers in their names, e.g. Karil's crossbow. It will become Karil's crossbow 100 the first time it's used in combat. Eventually it will degrade to Karil's crossbow 75, then 50, then 25 and finally 0 at which point the armour will be unusable until repaired. Additionally, Barrows equipment may only be traded if fully repaired or fully degraded. When dropped or lost on death, any piece of Barrows equipment will automatically degrade to 0. Players who attempt to drop Barrows equipment will receive a warning message about this. There are two ways to repair Barrows armour. Players can talk to any of the NPCs listed below and they will repair the items for a price, or repair the pieces themselves using an rsrc804 in any rsrc156. The equipment can be repaired at any stage, and the cost will be adjusted according to how much it has degraded. The repair costs below are as if the equipment has fully degraded. The following NPCs can repair the armour: Enter your smithing level here to calculate how much it would cost to repair the Karil's crossbow on an rsrc804: ",

This can be used to rsrc16098 to the three pyramids found in the desert, and by default, it can have up to three charges. Players who complete the rsrc5281 can have the sceptre hold more charges, up to eight with full completion. Teleporting by using this sceptre works up to level 30 in the rsrc464. When it's out of charges, talk to the rsrc8538 inside the Pyramid Plunder pyramid, and give it either 6 gold artifacts, 12 stone artifacts or 24 pottery/ivory artifacts to recharge it. Pharaoh's sceptres are rarely received from the golden chests and sacrophagi during the Pyramid Plunder minigame. The chance of receiving a Pharaoh's sceptre (1/1,000) is the same for every room upon a successful theft (meaning no rsrc8539 or rsrc1340 appear). After being found, the player will immediately be kicked from the pyramid by the guardian mummy. If the player has no free inventory spaces, the sceptre will appear under them outside the pyramid. Unlike most items, the sceptre disappears after 30 seconds if it is dropped to the ground after receiving it, so players should be careful to pick it up quickly. With the rsrc16087, the sceptre is required to make an rsrc1334 in one's own rsrc16454. This, in turn, caused the sceptre to be in high demand, giving it a significant price boost.  The sceptre can be used to teleport to the following pyramids: When the sceptre's charges are used, it may be recharged by using it on the rsrc8538 in the Pyramid Plunder minigame, with appropriate artefacts in the inventory (noted artefacts work). He will complain about the player owning it, but will go ahead and recharge it anyway. It is recommended that when a player has used all but one of the sceptre's charges, the last charge should be used to teleport to rsrc2109 for this reason. If players have multiple types of rewards in their inventory, e.g. stone seals and stone scarabs, and they select to recharge, the mummy will take the items with the lowest value first (of the selected category).  If the player talks to rsrc5278 while holding a sceptre, he will try to convince them that it is worthless and offers 100 gp for it, which the player refuses. When someone else in the pyramid finds a sceptre, an annoyed guardian mummy appears in some rooms next to the golden chest noting that someone has stolen it.",

When used, the player's max hit is increased by 10%, their accuracy is doubled, and it restores health equal to 50% of the hit and prayer by 25% of the hit (rounded up in even intervals) This effect only occurs when the player lands a successful hit, and any hit that deals below 22 damage will always heal the player for 10 hitpoints and restore 5 prayer points. In order for Healing Blade to restore more health and prayer, the hit must deal more than 22 damage; otherwise, the minimum of 10 hitpoints and 5 prayer points are used. The special attack will restore health and prayer even if used against a target that has lower health or has immunity to conventional weaponry. For example, rsrc614 can only be harmed by leaf-bladed weaponry, rsrc16459, or the rsrc1366 spell. If the Saradomin godsword would have hit a 40 on the kurask (which would result in 0 damage because it is not a leaf-bladed weapon, broad bolt or Magic Dart), it would still heal the player for 20 hitpoints and restore 10 prayer points. The same also applies to any killing blows by the special attack; if a target had 2 hitpoints remaining and was struck with a special hit that would have dealt 60 damage, the player would still be healed for 30 hitpoints and restore 15 prayer points. Players may use the Godsword's special to train against monsters as it will reduce food and prayer usage over time. The Saradomin Godsword's special can be used anywhere requiring food with an opponent to use the special attack on. Its special allows for very effective and quick healing, however, it does not provide as many healing opportunities as rsrc16460 set; it cannot replace Guthan's completely in many situations where constant healing is required. Since Godswords are two-handed weapons, they are not recommended for constant use against rsrc1694, rsrc410, or any monster requiring a shield to kill. However, the special attack can still be useful for its healing and prayer restoring effect with quick switches, especially when combined with an anti-fire potion which will negate most of the dragonfire damage even if the player is unlucky enough to get hit by it while vulnerable. rsrc5495 can be used as an alternative with chromatic dragons (or in conjunction with anti-fire potions), but it will not work against metal dragons' or wyverns' breath.

    "article-text": "The Saradomin sword is the personal weapon of rsrc606, the rsrc1222 general within the rsrc467. It can be obtained as a rare drop from Commander Zilyana, or as a very rare drop from her bodyguards. It is a rsrc361 which requires 70 rsrc28 to wield. Unlike most two-handed weapons in the game, it has an attack speed of 6, matching the speed of many commonly used melee weapons, such as scimitars and the rsrc252. Wielding this sword in the rsrc4110 will cause the rsrc4207 there to become hostile. Players can attach rsrc9242 to the Saradomin sword to create rsrc244, which has a +18 higher rsrc15936, +6 higher rsrc16328, and a different rsrc15915. This process, however, will cause the sword to be consumed, and cannot be undone.  The Saradomin sword has a rsrc1267, Saradomin's Lightning, that deals 10% more melee damage and 1-16 extra Magic damage. This special attack consumes 100% of the wielder's special attack energy. The special attack rolls against the opponent's Magic defence bonus using the player's slash attack bonus, thus making this special attack extremely accurate on melee armour. If the melee attack misses, then the Magic attack will also fail. However, if the melee hit is a rsrc813 but rolls a 0, the Magic damage will still be applied. Players receive 2 Magic experience for each point of damage caused by the extra Magic damage. The Magic damage will always hit 0 on rsrc372 in the rsrc50, as with all non-melee damage there. It will also hit 0 on rsrc2506 as he is immune to Magic damage. The Saradomin sword is identical to the rsrc252 in strength bonus, slash attack bonus and attack speed whilst also offering a secondary rsrc15934 attack style along with a small rsrc15902. Notably, the sword can be used to train rsrc64, as unlike the whip, it has an \"aggressive\" attack style. However, since the whip is a one-handed weapon and can therefore be used in conjunction with a rsrc15904 or a rsrc1898, the whip is generally the better option unless one wishes to gain Strength experience, or has need for crush attacks. As several weapons of similar tier were later introduced into rsrc16461, the Saradomin sword has since fallen out of popularity as the \"best\" weapon for training Strength. However, the sword is still comparable in power to other level 70 weapons, especially when cost efficiency is taken into account. This weapon is a common selection among rsrc16416, as their lower rsrc30 levels leave little options for strength bonus in off-hand items. Furthermore, the Saradomin sword lacks a \"controlled\" attack style and features an alternate \"defensive\" attacking animation, both of which can help players avoid inadvertently gaining Defence experience.  The Saradomin sword uses the same idle and combat animations as the rsrc1709. Unlike most 2h swords, the Saradomin sword attacks with an attack speed of 6, the highest tier of attack speed.",

Each vial and 300 blood runes adds 100 charges to the scythe, with it being able to hold up 20,000 charges (costing a total of 20,676,000 coins to fully charge it). Thus, one charge costs 1,033.8 coins. One charge is deducted per attack, and it will always lose a charge whether or not it hits. Note that once the charges are added to the scythe, they will not be returned should players decide to uncharge the scythe.  Upon release, the scythe of Vitur could be brought onto rsrc1106 despite being a weapon. This was fixed in rsrc16463 on 30 August 2018. The name of this weapon refers to the rsrc2317 House of rsrc16464, whose founder is worshipped as a god and wielded this scythe. Despite being a rsrc16462, the scythe of Vitur was not able to slash webs upon release. This was fixed in rsrc16465 on 2 August 2018.",

Compared to a rsrc1678, it has a slower rate of fire and a different rsrc15915 which is more effective against mages. The name can be attributed to the combination of the word seer (another word for \"mage or wizard\") and the word cull (another word for \"kill\"). In other words, the mage-killer. This is a fitting name because of the effect of its special attack and its examine text.  The seercull has a rsrc15915, Soulshot, which consumes 100% of the player's special attack energy. It is rsrc813 and lowers the rsrc59 level of the opponent by the damage dealt. However, damage inflicted by Soulshot is unaffected by Ranged rsrc81 (such as rsrc5551) and the rsrc286. Due to the nature of its special attack, the seercull is not commonly used in combat outside of rsrc15952. Rarely would a special attack that lowers the magic level come in use while training or fighting bosses. In PvP combat, the special attack gains use for its ability to lower the Magic level of a mage to prevent them from casting spells. However, this effect is likely to be mitigated by use of rsrc1053 potions, which are commonly used in lieu of rsrc16466. ",

Making a sled requires the following materials: First, the player must speak to rsrc799 to make the sled. Players must then use the rsrc3861 with the rsrc2655. The wax will then automatically go into their rsrc4081. Players should then use the rsrc3829 with the made sled. It is equipped when one needs to sled down Trollweiss during and after Troll Romance to get from the peak to near the southern base where the rare rsrc9562 flower grows. Players can obtain a new sled by the same method. If lost, a new sled can be obtained from Dunstan in exchange for a maple log, a rope and an iron bar. The sled is needed to access the Trollweiss mountain which is required by two rsrc92.  ",

Being part of Torag's barrows set, if Torag's hammers are wielded along with all of the other pieces of equipment in Torag's barrows set the player gains a special effect: damaging melee attacks have a chance of lowering the victim's run energy by 20%. This weapon cannot be made using the rsrc74 rsrc15940. Torag's hammers have lower popularity and value compared to other barrows weapons, as the hammers have a lower strength bonus and Torag's special effect is not as useful in combat. However, they have a high rsrc15934 bonus and can be one of the more likely out of the melee barrows weapons to hit as most armours have less crush defensive bonus than rsrc15936. * - Torag's hammers are only tradeable when undamaged or fully broken.  Barrows equipment rsrc16152 as it is used. Equipment received from the Barrows minigame is fully repaired and can be used for 15 hours of combat until it degrades completely and requires repair before it can be used again. Barrows armour degrades even if the player is using protection prayers or not taking damage. Unlike the rsrc802 and rsrc794, Barrows equipment does not suffer in performance as it degrades from fully repaired to fully degraded. Fully repaired Barrows items start out with no numbers in their names, e.g. Torag's hammers. It will become Torag's hammers 100 the first time it's used in combat. Eventually it will degrade to Torag's hammers 75, then 50, then 25 and finally 0 at which point the armour will be unusable until repaired. Additionally, Barrows equipment may only be traded if fully repaired or fully degraded. When dropped or lost on death, any piece of Barrows equipment will automatically degrade to 0. Players who attempt to drop Barrows equipment will receive a warning message about this. There are two ways to repair Barrows armour. Players can talk to any of the NPCs listed below and they will repair the items for a price, or repair the pieces themselves using an rsrc804 in any rsrc156. The equipment can be repaired at any stage, and the cost will be adjusted according to how much it has degraded. The repair costs below are as if the equipment has fully degraded.

The toxic blowpipe is charged with rsrc1344; it cannot be wielded if it is uncharged, except when fully degraded while equipped. It uses unpoisoned rsrc16474 as ammunition, and can hold up to 16,383 scales and 16,383 darts, costing 4,292,346 to fully charge. 2 scales are used for every 3 shots fired. A fully charged blowpipe lasts 8 hours and 12 minutes of non-stop combat with rapid attack style, or 12 hours and 17 minutes with accurate style. At the current price, it would cost 172.92 per shot, excluding the cost of darts. When charged with scales, the blowpipe has a Ranged attack of 60 and a Ranged strength of 40. These bonuses stack with the bonuses of its ammunition. For example, using rsrc16475 on the charged blowpipe will increase its Ranged attack to +78, and its Ranged strength to +60. The toxic blowpipe has a rsrc15915, Toxic Siphon, which increases damage by 50%, while healing the user by half of the damage dealt (rounded down). This consumes 50% of the player's special attack energy. Similar to the rsrc9228 special attack, it will heal the player based on what they would have hit if the target dies from the special attack; for example, if the hit was calculated to deal 20 damage and the target only has 5 Hitpoints, it will heal the player by 10 Hitpoints. It also heals based on the damage dealt before calculating damage reduction for certain monsters, such as rsrc2337 during its acid phase (where it will take 50% reduced damage) or rsrc16342 that have 100% damage resistance to most weaponry. 55 rsrc78 (rsrc1683)  65 rsrc78 (rsrc1690) +70 (rsrc1683)  +80 (rsrc1690)   In PvP situations upon release, the toxic blowpipe's attack speed was 8 on rapid, meaning it was able to attack every 1.2 seconds, which made it easy to overpower another opponent in player-versus-player combat. This was fixed in an rsrc16476 the next day so that the blowpipe's speed on rapid would be equal to that of a shortbow only in PvP; player-versus-monster encounters remain unaffected. Prior to rsrc16239 on 16 November rsrc125, the blowpipe envenomed NPCs at the same rate as envenoming players at a rate of 1 in 4 (25%) regardless of whether a serpentine helm was worn.",

    "article-text": "The twisted bow is a reward from the rsrc1178 that requires a rsrc78 level of 75 to wield. It can fire any type of arrow, including rsrc1684. The twisted bow is extremely valuable due to its unmatched power against monsters with a high magic level, such as rsrc606. Similar to rsrc794, the bow has an attack range of 10 tiles. As rsrc76 have a maximum of 10 range, rsrc10135 does not provide any benefit, but may be used to gain rsrc30 XP.  Unlike other bows that have a set strength, the twisted bow functions differently: the higher the target's rsrc59 level is, the higher the bow's accuracy and damage. The accuracy modifier is $ 140 + \\frac{3 Magic - 10}{100} - \\frac{(\\frac{3 Magic}{10} - 100) ^2}{100} $, with the cap at 140rsrc274. The damage modifier is $ 250 + \\frac{3 Magic - 14}{100} - \\frac{(\\frac{3 Magic}{10} - 140) ^2}{100} $ , with the cap at 250 outside the rsrc1178rsrc2761, and 350 within. Therefore, the maximum hit with the twisted bow outside of the rsrc1178 is 89 with rsrc1684 and 99 rsrc78, when using all damage boosting items and effects (rsrc1029, rsrc5310, rsrc1085, and rsrc286). The twisted bow is commonly used against bosses and strong monsters that use highly accurate and powerful magic attacks, such as rsrc606, rsrc622, rsrc860, or the mages and Jads in rsrc6113 and rsrc4994. In addition, some bosses have exceptionally high magic levels despite not using it as a combat style, such as rsrc2478, being very effective against them as well. However, against monsters that have a lower magic level, the twisted bow's damage and accuracy outputs are mediocre, typically performing worse than rsrc1695. This also applies to other players in PvP situations. The twisted bow used to have a damage modifier cap of 350, though it was capped to 250 in rsrc16477 on 19 January 2017 due to it dealing massive damage against bosses such as rsrc606. As a result of the twisted bow's introduction, rsrc719's magic level and magic defence bonus were adjusted as the bow originally outperformed other high-end weapons against him. The twisted bow is similar in function to the rsrc16478 in rsrc16012. There was a bug where the twisted bow's performance worsened in the Chambers of Xeric if it was used against monsters with a Magic level over 350. This was changed with an rsrc16155 on 12 April 2018 so that the bow treated the monster as if it had a Magic level of 350. The ranger rsrc14097 outside rsrc1573 wields a twisted bow, and it can be seen in one of the webs hanging in rsrc10821' room along with its owner. However, this particular bow is unreachable and does not display a red dot on the minimap.",

It is also affected by the rsrc2453 (rsrc2456, rsrc2460 and rsrc2150) which will increase the melee attack and melee strength by 10%. The damage bonus does stack with the Berserker necklace. Two of these are used to build an rsrc10043 at level 83 rsrc289 in a player's rsrc1228. The maul is used commonly in rsrc16479 because the only requirement is a Strength level of 60, which makes it possible to have a low rsrc173 while being able to deal high amounts of damage. However, one major drawback of this weapon is its poor attack speed. The maximum hit in a standard PvP fight with the maul is 63. This can be done by wearing an Obsidian helmet, platebody, platelegs, rsrc2452, rsrc2465, rsrc5318, rsrc2259, rsrc5321/rsrc5317 and using a rsrc5320 while having rsrc1266 active.  ",

To wield Verac's flail, a player must have 70 rsrc28. The flail shares many similarities to a rsrc5506, notably its attack styles and stat distribution. If Verac's flail is wielded along with all of the other pieces of equipment in Verac's set, the player receives the Defiler set effect. With this set effect active, player attacks have a chance (averaging 1/4) of hitting through an opponent's rsrc30 and rsrc81 entirely. This effect can be devastating towards tank opponents who rely on high defence; the player has potential to land high damaging hits consecutively, regardless of how high the defence level/bonuses are of the opponent or whether they are using prayers. With this set effect, Verac's flail can be considered one of the best weapons for certain rsrc16473 situations. This weapon cannot be made using the rsrc74 skill.  Barrows equipment rsrc16152 as it is used. Equipment received from the Barrows minigame is fully repaired and can be used for 15 hours of combat until it degrades completely and requires repair before it can be used again. Barrows armour degrades even if the player is using protection prayers or not taking damage. Unlike the rsrc802 and rsrc794, Barrows equipment does not suffer in performance as it degrades from fully repaired to fully degraded. Fully repaired Barrows items start out with no numbers in their names, e.g. Verac's flail. It will become Verac's flail 100 the first time it's used in combat. Eventually it will degrade to Verac's flail 75, then 50, then 25 and finally 0 at which point the armour will be unusable until repaired. Additionally, Barrows equipment may only be traded if fully repaired or fully degraded. When dropped or lost on death, any piece of Barrows equipment will automatically degrade to 0. Players who attempt to drop Barrows equipment will receive a warning message about this. There are two ways to repair Barrows armour. Players can talk to any of the NPCs listed below and they will repair the items for a price, or repair the pieces themselves using an rsrc804 in any rsrc156. The equipment can be repaired at any stage, and the cost will be adjusted according to how much it has degraded. The repair costs below are as if the equipment has fully degraded. The following NPCs can repair the armour: Enter your smithing level here to calculate how much it would cost to repair the Verac's flail on an rsrc804: ",

    "article-text": "The Zamorak godsword is one of the four variants of the rsrc1709 that was fought over during the rsrc1224. It is created by attaching a rsrc10460, obtained from rsrc381, to a completed rsrc1711. Like all godsword variants, it requires 75 rsrc28 to wield. Players can attach a rsrc10462, obtained from rsrc15927, to cosmetically enhance the godsword, creating a rsrc10461. This only alters its appearance, and gives no stat enhancements. It also becomes untradeable, returning both the godsword and the ornament kit when dismantled.  The Zamorak godsword has a rsrc15915, Ice Cleave, which consumes 50% of the player's special attack energy. It doubles the player's accuracy (slash or crush roll) and increases their max hit by 10%. In addition, it freezes the target in place for 20 seconds; the same duration as rsrc2988. The sword's special attack must produce a rsrc813 in order to have the freezing effect. Rolls against opponent's slash defence. rsrc16483 only does a damage reduction of max hit by 40%. Players have found a number of specific uses for the Zamorak godsword. It is very popular in the rsrc430 rsrc15988 when used to freeze flag-bearers, as such players generally wear rsrc78 armour such as rsrc16038 or rsrc1658 in order to more easily defend against enemy mages casting rsrc120. The Zamorak godsword's melee attacks counter this tactic. In the rsrc464, it can also be used to freeze an enemy in place in order to attack from a distance or escape; a useful tactic is logging out while standing under the enemy, as they will not unfreeze in time to retaliate. The Zamorak godsword has also found use in rsrc7621 situations. It is a popular weapon when fighting rsrc7013, as it can stop him long enough from going to the meat tree to heal. It can also be used during the rsrc797 minigame to freeze the melee-using brothers in place, particularly rsrc5319. ",

    "article-text": "The Zamorakian spear is obtained from the rsrc467 as a drop from rsrc381 and his bodyguards, requiring an rsrc28 level of 70 to wield. Like rsrc506, it is a two-handed weapon. With a speed of 6, the Zamorakian spear is faster than most other spears, which have a speed of 5, making it as fast as rsrc279, rsrc633 and the rsrc252. However, unlike other spears, it cannot be rsrc296, and has its highest bonus in rsrc15937, while other spears have the same bonus on all melee attack styles. The Zamorakian spear offers the second highest stab bonus of all weapons at +85, shared with the rsrc275 and rsrc4995, it is only outmatched by the rsrc245 with a stab bonus of +94. The Zamorakian spear is currently the strongest spear in the game. It is popular among players because of its versatility; it has stab, rsrc15936 and rsrc15934 options, making it useful on a wide array of monsters. Most notably, it is the strongest spear to use against the rsrc682. Overall, this weapon's total defence bonuses are the highest for any weapon. Many players consider this weapon to be an upgraded rsrc5523 because both of these spears have the same special attack, though they have different attack speeds, and the Zamorakian spear cannot be poisoned. Additionally, the Zamorakian spear's stab bonus outweighs its other bonuses, unlike the Dragon spear's balanced stats. rsrc504 can convert the spear into a rsrc275 for 300,000 rsrc321, or 150,000 coins if the player has completed the rsrc16484. The hasta has the exact same stats as the spear, but it is one handed. He can turn the rsrc275 back into a spear for free, should you so desire.  The Zamorakian spear has a rsrc15915, Shove, which it shares with the rsrc5523 and rsrc275. It pushes an opponent back and rsrc3080 them for three seconds, consuming 25% of the player's special attack energy. The effects of this special are non-stackable, meaning that players cannot use the spear's special attack on a target who is already stunned. In addition to this, players are given a one tick (0.6 seconds) period of immunity after a stun wears off in which they cannot be stunned again. In addition, it cannot be used against large monsters, such as giants, because they are too big to push back. If a player tries this, the special attack does not occur and no special attack energy is consumed. A message appears in the chat box, reading, \"That creature is too large to knock back!\" A general way to tell if the spear can use the \"Shove\" special attack is to determine how much space the target monster takes up. If it takes up more than one space, it cannot be shoved. For example, a player can shove an rsrc379, which takes up one space, but not an rsrc2489, which takes up four. ",

    "article-text": "The abyssal dagger is the most powerful rsrc279 in the game requiring 70 rsrc28 to wield. Players have a 13/64 (20.313%) chance of receiving an abyssal dagger when using an rsrc241 on the Font of Consumption at the centre of the rsrc270, giving it effectively a chance of 1/492 (0.203%) per rsrc242 kill. Players also have a 1/32,768 (0.003%) chance of receiving an abyssal dagger as a rsrc273 from rsrc272. The abyssal dagger surpasses the rsrc276 in both rsrc64 and accuracy, with +5 Attack bonus, and +3 Strength bonus. Players should note that the abyssal dagger is primarily a rsrc16485 while the staff of the dead is primarily a rsrc16462. The rsrc275 surpasses the abyssal dagger as a stab weapon with its rsrc15902, defensive stats, and additional stab attack bonus, but many players choose not to use it due to its combat styles being limited to defensive and controlled (shared).  The abyssal dagger has a rsrc15915, Abyssal Puncture, which hits twice in quick succession with a 25% increase in accuracy and 15% reduced damage, consuming 50% of the player's special attack energy. The special attack's first hit must deal damage for the second hit to deal damage. The highest the dagger can possibly hit with its special attack is 40-40 against players and 46-46 while using a rsrc271 against rsrc277 creatures. The abyssal dagger's special attack is arguably significantly weaker than the rsrc278's; this is evident when comparing the abyssal dagger's max hit of 40-40 which uses 50% special attack energy to the dragon dagger's max hit of 46-46 which uses 25% special attack energy.

    "article-text": "The abyssal tentacle is a weapon which requires 75 rsrc28 to wield. It is created by combining a rsrc297 with an rsrc252. It is an upgraded variant of the whip, having a +8 increase in Slash and +4 increase in Strength over its predecessor. It also has a 25% chance per hit to rsrc296 the opponent, which starts at 4 damage. It has the highest slash bonus of any one-handed weapon in Old School RuneScape. If the abyssal tentacle is not protected upon death, it will fully degrade into a kraken tentacle. However, if it is protected on death, it will remain in its regular state as the abyssal tentacle. In addition, the abyssal tentacle does not stack in the bank, regardless of the number of charges the Abyssal tentacles have. When using the items on each other there will be a warning message that states The tentacle will gradually consume your whip and destroy it. You won't be able to get the whip out again. The combined item is not tradeable. The abyssal tentacle has a rsrc15915, Binding Tentacle, which consumes 50% of the player's special attack energy, and binds a target for five seconds, as well as increasing the chance of poisoning them. Due to the volatile nature of the kraken tentacle, the abyssal tentacle degrades as it is used. Each hit costs 278.99 coins. After 10,000 hits with the weapon (400 minutes of continuous combat), it will degrade and consume the abyssal whip, leaving the player with only the kraken tentacle. If the player has a full inventory, the kraken tentacle will be left equipped in the weapon slot, useless and invisible. As of rsrc16486 on 31 March rsrc69, players can combine the charges of two abyssal tentacles. One fully charged abyssal tentacle is worth 10,000 charges, and the maximum one can be charged to, through adding additional abyssal tentacles (not kraken tentacles), is 20,000 charges. This action will destroy the other abyssal tentacle, making this action effectively cost a kraken tentacle as well. This feature can be very useful in rsrc16487 situations, where players may use hundreds of charges through several boss fights.  ",

    "article-text": "The abyssal whip is a one-handed rsrc16414 which requires an rsrc28 level of 70 to wield. The whip is among the most powerful and popular non-degradable melee weapons and is capable of attacking at the same speed of rsrc16488 and rsrc16489 at 2.4 seconds per hit. Alongside being a rare drop from rsrc272, there is a 12/128 (3/32) chance to obtain an abyssal whip when using rsrc241, dropped by the rsrc242, on the rsrc16411. A major downside of the abyssal whip is that it is not effective for training rsrc64; the only attack option available which will provide Strength rsrc19 is the \"lash\" attack option, which provides shared experience. As a result, several ostensibly weaker weapons are instead ideal for training Strength directly. Furthermore, the whip is sparingly used by certain rsrc299 as the wielder must incur Attack and/or rsrc30 experience.  The abyssal whip has a rsrc15915, Energy Drain, which consumes 50% of the player's special attack energy, increases accuracy by 25%, and in rsrc16067, transfers 10% of the target's run energy to the wielder. Players can attach a rsrc297 to the abyssal whip to create an rsrc295, which requires an rsrc28 level of 75 and has +8 higher rsrc15936 attack and +4 higher rsrc305, equating to about 1 higher damage. This process, however, will cause the whip to be consumed, and cannot be undone. Once the abyssal tentacle consumes all of its 10,000 charges, the player will retain the kraken tentacle. Players can also use either a rsrc300 or rsrc301, obtained from the rsrc303, to cosmetically enhance the abyssal whip, creating a rsrc302 or a rsrc298, respectively. This only alters its appearance, and causes the whip to become untradeable. It can be reverted by using a rsrc304 on the whip, but the mixes will not be returned.  An abyssal whip can be used in lieu of a rsrc556 when rsrc2068 rsrc2061 despite having no apparent blade. It can also be used to slice though rsrc16490.",

To wield Ahrim's staff, the player must have 70 rsrc59 and 70 rsrc28. Being part of Ahrim's set, if the staff is wielded along with all of the other pieces of equipment in the set the player receives a special effect: rsrc813 have a 25% chance of lowering the opponent's rsrc64 by five levels. This is cumulative with other effects that lower strength, namely the spell rsrc811. Wearing an rsrc800 in addition to the entire set provides an extra effect: the staff gains the ability to autocast rsrc120, and rsrc812 have a 25% chance of dealing 30% extra damage. However, this amulet cannot be used concurrently with the damage-boosting rsrc57.  Barrows equipment rsrc16152 as it is used. Equipment received from the Barrows minigame is fully repaired and can be used for 15 hours of combat until it degrades completely and requires repair before it can be used again. Barrows armour degrades even if the player is using protection prayers or not taking damage. Unlike the rsrc802 and rsrc794, Barrows equipment does not suffer in performance as it degrades from fully repaired to fully degraded. Fully repaired Barrows items start out with no numbers in their names, e.g. Ahrim's staff. It will become Ahrim's staff 100 the first time it's used in combat. Eventually it will degrade to Ahrim's staff 75, then 50, then 25 and finally 0 at which point the armour will be unusable until repaired. Additionally, Barrows equipment may only be traded if fully repaired or fully degraded. When dropped or lost on death, any piece of Barrows equipment will automatically degrade to 0. Players who attempt to drop Barrows equipment will receive a warning message about this. There are two ways to repair Barrows armour. Players can talk to any of the NPCs listed below and they will repair the items for a price, or repair the pieces themselves using an rsrc804 in any rsrc156. The equipment can be repaired at any stage, and the cost will be adjusted according to how much it has degraded. The repair costs below are as if the equipment has fully degraded. The following NPCs can repair the armour: Enter your smithing level here to calculate how much it would cost to repair the Ahrim's staff on an rsrc804:  Prior to rsrc16239 on 16 November rsrc125, Ahrim's staff was a two-handed staff, and did not have a 5% rsrc5740 bonus.",

The mace cannot be wielded until after a certain point in the quest; attempting to do so results in the message You must have received that mace in Another Slice of H.A.M in order to wield it. The ancient mace has stats in between those of a rsrc1270 and rsrc1268 and requires level 15 rsrc28 and level 25 rsrc81 to wield. In addition, it can be equipped to be protected against the rsrc1273 followers in the rsrc467. If lost, it can be retrieved from the rsrc873 archaeologist rsrc1265 for 1,000 rsrc321, north-east of the rsrc1271 marketplace.  The ancient mace has a rsrc15915 requiring 100% Special Attack energy, Favour of the War God, that hits through rsrc1264 and drains the rsrc81 points of the opponent by 100% of the amount hit and will recharge the user's prayer points by the same amount. The Ancient mace can raise your prayer points above your maximum prayer level, but only by the amount of damage you inflict with the special attack. It can be used to attack a rsrc1263 (or rsrc1262) in a rsrc156 rsrc1272 in order to maximise the Prayer surplus effect, as hitting the dummy will always result in the player's max hit. The special attack will restore prayer even if used against a target that has immunity to conventional weaponry such as Turoths and Kurasks. In addition, it is a useful tool for restoring prayer while in the rsrc238, after activating a power surge power-up, which gives the player infinite rsrc1267. In order to maximise the amount of rsrc16116 restored, activating a melee-boosting prayer (such as rsrc1266) before using the special attack is advised. There are 2 scenarios for this weapon's special attack. If the player's Prayer points is below their standard maximum prayer points, the damage dealt by the Mace is simply restored/added to the player's prayer points. For example, a player with a Prayer level of 50 has 20 prayer points left. Said player hits a 15 with the Ancient Mace special attack, and their new prayer points total becomes 35 [20 + 15]. This can also raise the player's prayer points above the normal maximum (e.g. the aforementioned player has 40/50 prayer points and hits a 15, the player's prayer points totals to 55). The second scenario is if the player's prayer points are greater than or equal to their normal maximum prayer points. In this case, the player's new prayer point total becomes the standard maximum + the damage dealt by the Ancient Mace special attack and only changes if this new total is greater than the current prayer point count. It should be stressed that this bonus is NOT additive. For example, if a player already has a boosted prayer point count of 60/50 and hits a 10 or less with the ancient mace special attack, there would be no change to the player's prayer points. However, should said player in this example hit above a 10 (e.g. a 15), their new prayer points becomes the damage dealt + the normal maximum prayer points (15 + 50 = 65). Following this example, said player needs to hit above a 15 to increase the prayer point total to their next highest hit + the base prayer point cap. Should they hit lower than a 15, nothing changes. This effect is most easily observed in Nightmare Zone using the power-surge ability, or in a Player-owned House with a Restoration pool or better and a combat ring with a second player.  Players cannot cast High or Low Level Alchemy on the Ancient mace; doing so results in the message: This ancient artifact resists your magic. However, players can sell the mace to General stores for 400 coins.",

    "article-text": "Arclight is an enhanced variant of rsrc1321 requiring level 75 rsrc28 to wield that is extremely effective against demon type monsters. In addition to an enhanced passive effect, Arclight features modest improvements in attack bonus and speed over the original sword. Arclight provides a 70% increase in accuracy and damage when used against rsrc1606 creatures, meaning it is more effective than an rsrc295 against these targets. Arclight retains rsrc1321's rsrc15915, Weaken, which uses 50% of the player's special attack energy and lowers the opponent's Strength, Attack, and Defence levels by 5% (10% for demons). Weaken's effect is only applied if it is a rsrc813. Use of the special attack does not detract from Arclight's charges. Special attack's accuracy roll is dependant on combat style type bonuses (stab or slash) which then rolls against a predefined stab defence roll rsrc274.  Arclight can be made by using rsrc1321 on the altar in the centre of the Zeah Catacombs with 3 rsrc1311 in the player's inventory. It initially has 1000 charges and gains an additional 1000 charges for every 3 shards added, and can hold a maximum of 10,000 charges. One charge is consumed for each successful attack when using Arclight, with the exception of special attacks. If all the charges are consumed, it will revert back to Darklight. The rarity of ancient shards is likely to prevent prolonged use of Arclight without it running out of charge. To avoid wastage, it is advisable to refrain from recharging Arclight when it is above 9000 charges since it will still cap at 10,000, thus wasting the shards' potential. If Arclight is lost, it can only be replaced by paying rsrc1607 1000 coins for Darklight and enhancing it with ancient shards again. Prior to the update of 23 February 2017, players were able to use low and high level alchemy on Arclight. Low level alchemy would convert the blade to 200 coins and high level alchemy would convert it to 300 coins. Prior to the update of 16 June 2016, Arclight did not have a special attack. The stats were reevaluated and changed after multiple player complaints on how the Arclight was not as strong as the newspost claimed when used against demons at higher combat levels. The same update also gave it a rsrc16285. A second Arclight can be created and will have 1000 charges independent of any other Arclights in possession.",

The Armadyl crossbow has a rsrc15915, Armadyl Eye, which doubles the player's overall accuracy (level + gear accuracy) for that shot, consuming 40% of the player's rsrc15915 energy.

The Armadyl crossbow is one of four unique boss drops that are not dropped by the respective bodyguards (excluding hilts or pets), the others being rsrc1367, rsrc9244 and rsrc276. There's a 1/250 chance that when one receives a rsrc16079 from woodcutting, instead of the standard bird chirping sound, they'll hear the crossbow's special attack sound instead.

This requires 73 rsrc1887, and will give the player 315 Hunter experience per catch. To use chinchompas in rsrc712, they must be wielded in the rsrc16378. Black chinchompas are thrown like rsrc16474 or rsrc16507; however, they explode on impact. They can hit up to 10 (as opposed to 9 with other chinchompas) targets in a 3x3 area. They cannot be picked up again from the ground after being thrown and rsrc143 does not return them, since they are live animals. Black chinchompas have a rsrc469 bonus of +30, as opposed to +15 from rsrc1683 and +0 from rsrc16508. Using black chinchompas is widely regarded as the fastest way to train Ranged and rsrc65; however, this method is very costly. Catching black chinchompas is also popular among high-level Hunters as it gives fast experience and is profitable. Attack speed: Fuses are used to describe the attack speed for throwing chinchompas. It is just another name for the conventional styles of ranged training. Short fuse (accurate): 4 ticks Medium fuse (rapid): 3 ticks Long fuse (long range): 4 ticks Note: If a player rsrc2672 with black chinchompas in their inventory or equipped, the chinchompas will disappear and cannot be retrieved. This is due to the fact that the chinchompa is a live animal, meaning it can run away. This does not apply in the rsrc464, however, as the player who killed you will be able to pick up any chinchompa stacks you have upon death. In addition, players cannot release chinchompas while in combat.  Using black chinchompas is a practical way of training rsrc78 and rsrc65, since combat experience per hour is determined by how much damage the player can deal. It is best used against multiple aggressive targets occupying a 1x1 space and piled together, such as the rsrc2669 of rsrc1256 or the rsrc376 in rsrc2670, as these monsters are highly aggressive and easily stack on top of each other, meaning that you will deal plenty of damage against them. They can also be used when fighting rsrc1660. Lure him into melee distance and then attack rsrc1656 with the chinchompas. Kilisa's rsrc30 (both in levels and ranged defence) are lower then Kree'arra's, meaning that you will hit more often and damage both of them in the process. Chinchompas either deal some or no damage, meaning that if it hits the primary target, all other applicable targets will get hit and the same applies if it misses.  Chinchompas were actually inspired by the rsrc16509.",

The Blurite sword has a missing section in the hilt's grip above the player's hand and just below the crossguard. It was called the 'Faladian Knight's sword' in rsrc4783.",

The brine sabre is a slightly better alternative to a rsrc364, boasting 2 higher rsrc64 and rsrc15936 attack bonuses when compared to the former. However, it is significantly more expensive due to the fact it is only dropped by the rarely-killed rsrc16515 at a rate of 1/512. Brine sabres can finish off rsrc1957 without the use of a rsrc1954. It is also one of the only weapons that can be used to kill rsrc3533. It is required for a rsrc91.  The brine sabre is the best-in-slot training weapon for level 40 rsrc28 rsrc299 who train on rsrc17 rsrc3531. It was also previously the best-in-slot training weapon for rsrc3532 pures who lacked 55 rsrc285 (in which the rsrc3530 was better as it provided +20 higher offensive and +3 Strength bonuses), however it has since been superseded with the release of the rsrc3534, which provides +10 higher offensive and Strength bonuses. The brine sabre has a special attack, Liquefy, which doubles the player's accuracy, and increases the player's rsrc64, rsrc28 and rsrc30 levels by 25% of the damage dealt. The special attack only works underwater, and consumes 75% of the player's special attack energy.  On release, the brine sabre did not mitigate the need to use a bag of salt to finish off a rockslug. This was added in an rsrc16516 on 28 July rsrc69.",

    "article-text": "The bronze dagger is a rsrc279 made out of rsrc3604. It is the most basic dagger in Old School Runescape, with the rsrc3233 surpassing it. Players are able to make a bronze dagger using the rsrc74 skill. This requires one rsrc3598 and a rsrc422 and yields 12.5 Smithing rsrc19. There are no level requirements to create or wield a bronze dagger. It is the second-weakest dagger in the game. It outperforms the rsrc3643/rsrc3642, an artefact obtained during rsrc192, which has marginally superior accuracy bonuses but no strength bonus at all. It is the first weapon that players obtain, during the Smithing tutorial on rsrc3645. Despite becoming seemingly obsolete as the player is given a rsrc3622 in the next section of the tutorial, the bronze dagger does have some usefulness during the rsrc3646's task given its small magic attack bonus.  A bronze dagger can be found on top of some drawers in the rsrc2026 room in rsrc1461. They can also be bought from various weapon stores. The bronze dagger is denounced by rsrc3738 as being a \"butter knife\". Because of this, it is commonly regarded as the \"worst\" weapon in the game, however, the rsrc3601 arguably deals less damage per second.",

There are many variations of the butterfly net which provide special bonuses or experience boosts to the player. Nets can be purchased at low prices from the rsrc4029 in rsrc1632 and rsrc1183 for 24 coins. You can also obtain one for free at rsrc2515 in rsrc2205, in one of the boxes in the town. They may also be obtained through the rsrc4030 which is obtained using a level 71 spell in the rsrc16519. In order to make use of the net, rsrc2880 are also needed; they could also be bought from Hunter shops for 1 coin each. Players can right-click their butterfly nets to track how many implings they have caught inside Puro-Puro and the surface world. Implings that are caught barehanded are also tracked on this log.  ",

This requires 53 rsrc1887, and will give the player 198.4 Hunter experience per catch. They have a catch rate of about 146/268 at 53 hunter level and a guaranteed chance to catch at 95 hunter level rsrc274.To use chinchompas in rsrc712, they must be wielded in the rsrc358 rsrc16520. Chinchompas are thrown like rsrc16474 or rsrc16507; however, they explode on impact. They can hit up to 9 targets in a 3x3 area. They cannot be picked up again from the ground after being thrown, and rsrc3213 does not return them. Throwing a chinchompa at a group determines the hit for the whole group, so if the chin hits a 0 on one member of the group, it will hit a 0 on all of them; if it hits a 10 on one member, it will hit within that range of all members of the group. Attack speed: Fuses are used to describe the attack speed for throwing chinchompas. It is just another name for the conventional styles of ranged training. Short fuse (accurate): 4 ticks Medium fuse (rapid): 3 ticks Long fuse (longrange): 4 ticks Note: If a player dies with chinchompas in their inventory or equipped, the chinchompas will disappear and cannot be retrieved. This is due to the fact that the chinchompa is a live animal, meaning it can run away. However, if you are in the Wilderness and die, the player who killed you can pick up your chinchompas.  Using chinchompas for training, often called chinning, is a practical way of training rsrc78 and rsrc65 due to the fact that experience rates are based on DPS (damage per second). This causes high demand for them, and thus are generally expensive, but cheaper than their stronger counterparts, being the rsrc1683 and rsrc1690. Chinchompas are commonly used for training on rsrc2669 in the rsrc45. The rsrc4371 works with chinning on rsrc277 creatures because chinchompas ignore the rsrc30 of the targets surrounding the primary target and only uses the primary target's Defence in determining if you hit everyone or none. Chinchompas are inspired by rsrc16509.",

    "article-text": "Darklight is a magic sword created from the sword Silverlight during the rsrc2704 quest. In that quest, rsrc2789 is transformed into Darklight after being dyed with rsrc2660 and then being used to destroy the demon rsrc16530, which coats it in ichor. In addition, being that it is still made of silver, it is effective against rsrc2317. Both rsrc2789 and Darklight can be rsrc5171 on the wall of a rsrc1096 in a rsrc156 at 42 rsrc289. If lost, Darklight can be repurchased from rsrc1607 in Varrock Palace for 1,000 coins. Note: Darklight can only be replaced if all Silverlights are dropped.  Against non-demonic enemies, Darklight is a fairly weak weapon with bonuses equivalent to that of a rsrc2781. When using Darklight to fight rsrc1325, rsrc619, rsrc843 or rsrc272, rsrc2487, or rsrc2317, the player's maximum hit is increased to approximately the same level as a rsrc90; however, its accuracy remains the same. The Darklight has a rsrc15915, Weaken, which consumes 50% of the player's special attack energy and lowers the opponent's rsrc64, rsrc28, and rsrc30 levels by 5% (10% for demons) of their max level. This special is only activated when the player hits accurately and multiple special attacks will stack.rsrc274 The Darklight can be upgraded into the rsrc1324 by using three rsrc1311 on the Altar in the centre of the rsrc1323. Doing so further increases the effectiveness against demons and changes attack speed to 6. 75 Attack is required to wield the Arclight. ",

When a player takes the staff from the skeleton, a chatbox message will state You find the Dawnbringer; you feel a pulse of energy burst through it. It shares the same bonuses as the rsrc1361 and the rsrc1346, and is used to break Verzik Vitur's shield during the first phase of the final fight against her, with the damage having a unique cyan rsrc5181 (rsrc16531). After her shield is destroyed, the Dawnbringer will crumble to dust. When this occurs, a message in the chatbox will state The weapon falls apart in your hand as Verzik's shield is destroyed. The Dawnbringer cannot be brought outside of the raid. Should players somehow successfully smuggle it out of the raid, it is automatically destroyed.rsrc274  The staff's rsrc15915, Pulsate, fires a powerful blast towards rsrc1574, inflicting 80-150 rsrc65 of damage towards her and consuming 35% of the wielder's special attack energy. As players must deplete her health quickly before all the pillars in her throne room collapses, it is mandatory for teammates to drop the staff for another player to perform the special attack once they have depleted their own special attack energy.  When the rsrc1573 was released, there was a bug where players who died would drop another item in their inventory, and they would respawn outside with the Dawnbringer instead.rsrc2761 Jagex quickly hotfixed the issue, and as the only player who saw a disadvantage was an rsrc6909 whose rsrc1657 went to one of their party members, Jagex swapped the item back to its original owner.rsrc5332 This hotfix also made it so the Dawnbringer automatically crumbles to dust once it is no longer needed in the fight.",

    "article-text": "The dragon axe is the strongest and fastest rsrc66 rsrc3514 in the game, tied with the rsrc62. It is 5-10% more efficient at chopping logs than the rsrc391. It is both a rsrc16421 (requiring 60 rsrc28 to wield) and a rsrc66 tool (requiring 61 Woodcutting to use). However, as long as the player has 60 Attack to wield the axe, the rsrc15915 can be used to woodcut with the axe starting at level 58. The dragon axe is obtained as a rare drop from rsrc393, rsrc909 and rsrc457, which inhabit the rsrc1599. It can also be found as a very rare reward from a rsrc354, which is obtained after earning at least 500 points during the fight against the rsrc348.  The dragon axe has a rsrc15915, Lumber Up, that provides a visible +3 boost to rsrc66 (meaning that from level 72-74 Woodcutting, you can use the special attack to obtain rsrc1756 from a rsrc4750). This consumes 100% of the player's special attack energy, though it cannot be used without the 60 Attack required to wield the axe. Using the special attack every 5 minutes increases experience rates by about 1%. The special lasts at least two minutes, but no more than three minutes and decays three times. Using rsrc5411 can increase the duration by 50%. As long as the player has 60 Attack required to wield the axe, the special attack can be used to woodcut with the axe starting at level 58.  Players can combine a rsrc5412 with a dragon axe to create an rsrc390, which requires 85 rsrc317 (cannot be boosted) to do so. This process cannot be undone. The infernal axe will grant the player a 1/3 chance to burn logs for Firemaking experience whilst cutting. The infernal axe will be able to burn 5,000 logs before degrading, requiring another smouldering stone or dragon axe to charge it.  The dragon axe's rsrc15915 was formerly known as Clobber, which lowered the opponent's rsrc30 and rsrc59 by 10%. This was changed in an update on 27 March 2014 to boost a player's rsrc66 level by 3, much like the rsrc96. The special attack was also renamed in a later update. As with all rsrc5507, the dragon axe is unique in appearance to its lesser metal counterparts; the dragon axe's blade looks more like a dragon's wing (similar to the rsrc5001's) than a regular axe blade.",

As with all rsrc16533, players cannot obtain this item through the rsrc74 skill.  The dragon battleaxe has a rsrc15915, Rampage; when toggled, the player character immediately hefts the weapon above their head, consuming 100% of their special attack energy. This drains the player's rsrc28, rsrc30, rsrc78, and rsrc59 levels by 10%, while increasing their rsrc64 level by [10 + (levels drained / 4)]. The strength boost is comparable to that of a rsrc1028 potion. However, depending on the player's combat levels and preexisting boosts, it can raise strength by up to +21. This accounts for the popularity of this weapon; although it is seldom used in combat, it is entirely possible to use Rampage for a strength boost and then revert to a primary melee weapon. The drained stats can be recovered using a rsrc1034. Alternatively, drinking from a rsrc5415/rsrc5416 eliminates the hefty stat penalties and special energy cost of Rampage while retaining the strength boost. The dragon battleaxe is popularly used in lieu of rsrc1036 in the rsrc5401 minigame, as the player's special attack meter is refilled along with their rsrc65, rsrc16116 and rsrc15971 at the conclusion of each game. With the highest possible levels and boosts, 120/99 Strength is achieved using this weapon's special attack.",

    "article-text": "Poison: 14,400 coins The dragon dagger (sometimes referred to as DD or DDS/DDP++ in its rsrc16535 form) is the second strongest rsrc279 in rsrc15920 and can be wielded by players with at least 60 rsrc28, after completion of the rsrc527 quest. The dagger is popular due to its cheap price and its potentially devastating rsrc15915. The dragon dagger can be purchased from rsrc5450 in the rsrc3820 marketplace for 30,000 coins, or from rsrc5449 near the rsrc160 for 60,000 coins. rsrc5448 also sells them in her shop in rsrc450, although they will never be in stock unless a player sells some to her first.  The dragon dagger's special attack, Puncture, deals 2 hits at once with an extra 25% accuracy and 15% max hit for each of the 2 hits, consuming 25% of the wielder's special attack energy. Puncture rolls against opponent's slash defence roll. When used against other players, both hits are applied simultaneously. There is a slight delay between the 2 hits when the special is used on NPCs. The special attack's highest possible hit under normal combat conditions is 50 damage for each of the 2 hits, or a total of 100 damage. Although rare, the poisoned dagger's special attack is known to occasionally stack with the rsrc4745 damage, resulting in a theoretical maximum hit of 106. For these reasons, the dragon dagger is a staple 'knock-out' weapon in rsrc15952 combat, and a cheap option for a high damage spec weapon in rsrc16473. rsrc4999 are often superior, but carry a much higher price.  The rsrc2974 that may be encountered during rsrc1336 uses a poisoned dragon dagger, and is capable of using the special attack rapidly. rsrc4508 and melee-using rsrc4650 also use a poisoned dragon dagger. If the dragon dagger's special attack deals more damage than required to kill the opponent, it will provide experience for the surplus damage, unlike other weapons.",

Equipping the crossbow requires 65 rsrc78 and increases both accuracy and damage by 30% when fighting rsrc16536 (excluding rsrc4775 and rsrc1011), as well as rsrc15905 and the rsrc1696. This stacks additively with rsrc5471, not multiplicatively. The crossbow will, however, stack multiplicatively with the rsrc16537 (49.5%). rsrc5472 and rsrc5470 cannot be used with this weapon, unlike the similarly named rsrc5469 that can fire them. rsrc409 may be used, however, they require 55 rsrc285 to use. The crossbow has an attack range of 7. Longrange increases attack range by 2.   Upon release, the dragon hunter crossbow had a 10% accuracy and damage bonus. This was changed to 30% in rsrc16122 on 25 January 2018. The rsrc16538 for the dragon hunter crossbow was formerly 70, but was changed to 8 in rsrc16539 on 29 March 2018 to combat price manipulation on the rsrc490.",

    "article-text": "The dragon pickaxe was released with the rsrc464 Rejuvenation on 13 March 2014. It is dropped by all the rsrc16541 (not rsrc16542) and the rsrc616. It is tied for the strongest and fastest pickaxe in-game, along with the rsrc95. The pickaxe mines ore at an increased speed (1/6 chance to mine an ore one tick faster than the rsrc3588rsrc274). An rsrc28 level of 60 is required to wield the pickaxe, while 61 rsrc21 is required to mine ores with the pickaxe. However, as long as a player has 60 Attack to wield the pickaxe, the rsrc15915 can be used to mine with the pickaxe starting at level 58.  The dragon pickaxe's rsrc15915, Rock Knocker, temporarily boosts the player's rsrc21 level by 3 (players will need to have 60 rsrc28 to utilise this special). This consumes 100% of the player's special attack energy. As long as a player has 60 Attack to wield the pickaxe, the special attack can be used to mine with the pickaxe starting at level 58. Players can combine a rsrc5412 with a dragon pickaxe to create an rsrc5513, requires 85 rsrc74 (boosts not allowed) to do so. This process cannot be undone. The infernal pickaxe will grant the player a 1/3 chance to smelt ores for Smithing experience whilst mining. The infernal pickaxe will be able to smelt 5,000 ores before degrading, requiring another smouldering stone or dragon pickaxe to charge it. Players can also use a rsrc5512, obtained from the rsrc303, to cosmetically enhance their dragon pickaxes, creating a rsrc5511. This only alters its appearance, and makes the pickaxe untradeable. The process can be reverted, but the kit will not be retained.  When the rsrc15915 is used, the player will say \"Smashing!\". This may be a reference to the catchphrase of the fictional character Nigel Thornberry from the cartoon rsrc16543.",

It can only be wielded by players who have an rsrc28 level of 60 and have completed the rsrc47 quest. It may be purchased from rsrc5522 on rsrc1256 for 100,000 coins. A rsrc16544 does not need to be worn, as players can just right-click 'Trade' on Daga; however, you still must be in rsrc16545. Players who have freed rsrc16068 in rsrc484 can easily reach Ape Atoll through the rsrc2070 spell (requires 64 rsrc59) to access rsrc5520 on Ape Atoll more quickly. The scimitar is also a rare drop from the rsrc464 boss rsrc741. Players can attach a rsrc5518, obtained from rsrc15918, to cosmetically enhance the scimitar, creating a rsrc5521. This only alters its appearance, and gives no stat enhancements. It can be dismantled, returning the scimitar and ornament kit. As with most rsrc1691 equipment, the dragon scimitar cannot be made from raw materials using the rsrc74 skill.  The dragon scimitar has a rsrc15915, Sever, which hits with increased accuracy and prevents the target (players only) from using the rsrc5495, rsrc3014, and rsrc1264 prayers for 5 seconds, consuming 55% of the player's special attack energy. Sever does not affect the rsrc5519 prayer. Rolls against the target's slash defence rsrc274. The dragon scimitar is arguably the seventh best one-handed training weapon in the game, behind the rsrc245, rsrc295, rsrc252, rsrc268, rsrc275, and the rsrc276. However, due to whips and hastae being unable to solely train strength, the dragon scimitar is commonly used to do so, and is therefore regarded as one of the best weapons in the game to train strength. In comparison, the rsrc247 offers a +82 Strength bonus and +82 rsrc15936 attack. The rsrc244 offers a +88 Strength bonus and +100 slash attack. The rsrc252 offers a +82 Strength bonus and +82 slash attack. The rsrc268 offers a +75 Strength bonus and +75 stab attack.  The dragon scimitar was not actually released until almost four months after the release of the rsrc47 quest on 29 March 2005. If the player asked rsrc11677 to sell them a dragon scimitar, he would say, \"Seriously, you'll be a monkey's uncle before you'll ever hold a dragon scimitar.\" The joke is that in the Monkey Madness quest, the player plays the role of a monkey's uncle to complete a certain part of the quest, and completing the quest is required to wield the dragon scimitar.",

    "article-text": "The dragon warhammer is a rsrc671 that requires an rsrc28 level of 60 to wield and is currently the strongest warhammer available in Old School RuneScape. It is obtained as a very rare drop from rsrc2479. The dragon warhammer can be used as a substitute for a regular rsrc422 when banging the big door at the entrance of rsrc676 in the God Wars Dungeon, as well as be used in the rsrc1178 to stun rsrc5536 and build any rsrc5537, assuming they have the appropriate amount of rsrc5535 and the rsrc289 level needed to create the chest. The dragon warhammer is popular for its special attack, as it can drastically reduce the opponent's defence and make them an easier target.  The dragon warhammer has a rsrc15915, Smash, which deals 50% more damage, while lowering the target's current rsrc30 level by 30% on a hit other than zero (the hit has to deal damage - even if it is a rsrc813 but rolls a zero, it does not work).rsrc274 When used against rsrc2127, it will reduce 5% of his Defence level if it fails to hit. This attack consumes 50% of the player's special attack energy. Defence level reductions do stack over multiple successful hits; each reduction is calculated from the current temporary level (so follow-up drains reduce fewer levels). Two successful special attacks thus reduce an opponent's Defence by a total of 51%. The dragon warhammer can be considered a one-handed variant of the Bandos godsword. While its bonuses may not be as high (and all of its attack styles being crush), it can be used with an rsrc1897 or rsrc250 to boost its accuracy rate, and the defence reduction is typically larger if it hits. The dragon warhammer's special attack does not lower offensive stats even if the opponent's Defence is zero. If planning to drain offensive stats after draining defensive stats, use a rsrc2126.  The dragon warhammer's special attack animation and effect is similar to that of the rsrc16550 released in rsrc16551. On release, the dragon warhammer was not considered a substitute for accessing Bandos' Stronghold in the God Wars Dungeon. This was changed by rsrc16552 on 24 March 2016.",

Players can obtain the staff by using a knife on a rsrc3780 which requires a rsrc263 level of 31. It is possible to return to the island and cut more branches, although it is advised players make multiple staffs upon completion of the quest as this prevents the need for a return trip if the staff is lost. The Dramen staff is also required for rsrc4594 teleportation which requires partial completion of the quest rsrc4587. Players doing the rsrc205 quest can upgrade their staff to a rsrc5561 that has the same effects. If the player has completed elite rsrc608, no staff is needed for fairy ring teleportation. The Dramen Staff can also be used to defeat rsrc16553 during rsrc34 quest by smuggling in a rsrc3780 and a rsrc556.   The dramen staff was rsrc14782 in rsrc16554 on 12 July rsrc231 after passing the rsrc16142. Before its rework, it looked the same as a rsrc815.",

It depends on which type of gorilla's bones used. If players used the bones from the level 167 bearded gorilla they will receive the rsrc16571 greegree. If players used a regular gorilla greegree they will get the unbearded version. Overall there are 8 greegrees, including the large and small ninja greegrees, large and small zombie greegrees, bearded, blue faced and normal gorilla greegrees and the Karamjan greegrees.  ",

    "article-text": "The granite hammer is a rsrc671 dropped by the rsrc426 that can be found on the rsrc2865's rooftop. Level 50 rsrc28 and rsrc64 are required to wield it. It acts as a rsrc6629 in the inventory, but will automatically smash rsrc253 when it is equipped. Unlike standard warhammers, the granite hammer features an attack speed of 6, matching the speed of more commonly used melee weapons (such as scimitars and rsrc252), which results in significantly more damage over time. Thus, in terms of overall power, the granite hammer falls roughly between the rsrc364 and rsrc639. In comparison to the rsrc3530, the granite hammer has slightly poorer accuracy but a greater strength bonus and a special attack. However, the leaf-bladed sword is far easier to obtain, especially for rsrc16104.  The granite hammer has a rsrc15915, Hammer Blow, which consumes 60% of the player's special attack energy, and deals an attack with 50% increased accuracy, while guaranteeing 5 additional damage to that attack. Even if the special attack misses, the target will still take a minimum of 5 damage from it. This excludes NPCs that are immune to normal forms of attack, such as rsrc3012 and rsrc16572 the player does not have the rsrc285 level to attack.  The examine text is a reference to the song U Can't Touch This by MC Hammer. The granite hammer's special attack shares its animation with the dragon warhammer. On release this included the red \"ghost\" effect trailing it; this was changed to a grey trail shortly after release.",

It cannot be made by players who have not made sufficient progress into the quest.

Once the water is gathered into the bowl via a reed cut from the tall reed plants by the pool with a machete, it will need to be poured into enchanted vials which, when filled, are stackable. One bowl will fill 10 enchanted vials. It is also possible to enchant the vials and siphon the sparkling water directly from the pool into the vials, but this is slower, since only one vial is filled per reed. The most effective way to make Holy water in bulk is to make 27 or 28 if dropping 1 bowl while filling the others blessed gold bowls (takes a while), fill them, and use rsrc6991 to teleport to rsrc3139. It is important to note that if you try to leave the jungle on foot, the water will disappear from your bowls. ",

    "article-text": "Iban's staff is a rsrc2335 used to cast rsrc848. The staff is obtained by defeating the evil mage rsrc1108 at the end of rsrc1064. Iban's staff requires 50 rsrc59 and 50 rsrc28 to wield. Iban's staff is required to cast rsrc848. The maximum hit with Iban Blast is 25, making it excellent for low-level rsrc518 and rsrc797. Casting Iban Blast on an NPC consumes one charge from the staff, and casting it on another player consumes two charges. The staff can hold up to 120 charges. Note that other rsrc16576, like rsrc867, do not use any charges. If the player wants to recharge the staff to its maximum charges, the player must go through the rsrc468 to the \"Flames of Zamorak,\" the well located right after the three level 62 rsrc4772 in the Underground Pass. The Paladins do not have to be killed again in order to recharge the staff. Reaching the well becomes much easier once the player has completed rsrc495, as the player can then use the Elf entrance to reach the well, which is much quicker and easier than using the rsrc23 entrance. Alternatively, players may pay the rsrc7040 100,000 coins to charge it for them. If the staff is upgraded, the cost increases to 250,000 coins. If the staff is lost, the player must kill rsrc16577 until a broken Iban's staff is dropped. This can then be repaired by the rsrc7040 at the front of the Underground Pass near the western house of rsrc2248 for 200,000 coins. Players can pay 200,000 rsrc321 to the dark mage to create rsrc16578, which fully recharges the staff and allows it to hold 2500 charges instead of 120. This can only be done if the player has completed rsrc1064 by speaking to rsrc4567. Players can receive multiple staves using the drop trick before killing an Iban disciple to obtain a broken Iban's staff which can be repaired to give a duplicate. However, all duplicate staves share the same charges whether in the player's inventory or bank, thus still requiring a recharge every 120 casts. As a rsrc507 weapon, the Iban staff has the same stats as a rsrc2330. Every time you equip Iban's staff, the game chat will state \"You equip the staff of Iban.\"  ",

Upgrading the staff will also recharge it.

The staff he will give you is the basic Iban's staff; you must pay the upgrade fee of 200,000 coins again to regain Iban's upgraded staff.

Players with at least level 32 rsrc1870 can get an Iron dagger (p) by pickpocketing rsrc4768. Rogues are located southwest of the deep rsrc464 rsrc4903. It is superior in accuracy to the rsrc3622. As it is a common and inexpensive item, an iron dagger is more likely to be obtained by new players than other iron weaponry. ",

This flail is effective in damaging and killing the rsrc3012 because, despite their sufficient mind-reading ability to predict attacks and avoid damage, the flail is incredibly unpredictable and random. The sickle head further increases the unpredictability of the weapon. Thus, attackers do not hit the Vyrewatch in the intended way, rendering their mind-reading useless. The flail can cast rsrc218, the same as a silver sickle (b). This multiplicity of use lets a player kill rsrc2320, rsrc399, and rsrc3012 with a single weapon. While players can make a flail themselves after the quest, it is much easier to purchase one from rsrc7213 for 20,000 coins in the old rsrc4273 under rsrc5554's home. The flail has a damage bonus against vampyres of 20%. The Ivandis flail has a special attack, Retainer, which traps a rsrc16589 or rsrc16590 that has 50% or less hitpoints remaining, preventing it from retaliating. This consumes 10% of the player's special attack energy.  Despite having only having a Crush attack style available as a melee weapon, the Flail also has Stab and Slash bonuses.",

    "article-text": "The Karamjan monkey greegree is used for transforming into a rsrc1066 type rsrc5922 at the rsrc1256 island. To make a greegree, a player must take a rsrc1252 and rsrc3293 or rsrc7313 to rsrc2379, who can be found at the very end of the rsrc45. When in the monkey form, all monsters on the rsrc1256 island become non-aggressive. This effect is only in place on Ape Atoll as Zooknock cannot use his magic over long distances. However, for reasons unknown, it can also be used at the rsrc937. Be aware that a greegree may not be wielded while in combat. The greegree is used in the rsrc47 quest and is also useful in the rsrc7314 quest. At the very start of Monkey Madness, players will only be able to obtain a Monkey talisman by talking to the crying child in the house to the west of the monkey settlement when wearing the rsrc5840. When they have had the greegree charged by Zooknock, additional rsrc1252 can be bought from the rsrc6019 for 1,000 coins each.  There are mahogany and teak trees in the jungle outside rsrc7315 on rsrc1256. With the enchanted greegree equipped, the creatures on the island will not be aggressive. The zombie monkey greegree (using the bones from the zombie monkeys in the dungeon) is very slow (you cannot run when using it). You will need to wear the rsrc5840 to speak monkey. The greegree may be used in the rsrc937 after the quest, but there are restrictions on where players may travel as a monkey. ",

If confirmed, the chatbox will then state Power shoots down the length of the wand, empowering it with the darkness of Xeric's Kodai wizards.  Upon release, the Kodai wand was received as a complete drop. Jagex stated that this was unintentional, as the wand was supposed to be created with a rsrc7417 and a master wand. The next week, the Kodai wand was replaced with the Kodai insignia drop and all wands that were obtained prior to the update were kept as normal. In addition, the wand did not have its 15% chance of negating rune costs when casting offensive spells; this was added in two weeks later. The kodai wand appears similar in design to the rsrc16592 from the Harry Potter series. This is also reinforced by the fact that the Kodai wand was named the rsrc5739 in its beta form.

The staff is dropped by the rsrc2464, rsrc623, rsrc363, rsrc2998 and rsrc2681. Players can give 40,000 coins to rsrc2336, after the completion of the rsrc2218 quest, to upgrade the staff to a rsrc7482. Many players deem this staff as nearly useless as the only spell to use both earth and fire runes is rsrc1079. However, when training magic at the Magic Training Arena, this staff is the best staff once you're 87 Magic for getting Enchantment points. It is also useful for enfeeble-alching. One more notable use of the Lava staff would be the saving of a single inventory space while carrying teleports to both the Fire rune teleports (rsrc7484, rsrc7485, and rsrc2070), in addition to the Earth rune teleports (rsrc7483, rsrc1631, and rsrc3525). Wielding a lava staff would therefore allow all of these teleports while the player holds law and air runes; the exception being Ape Atoll also requiring 2 water runes. Players can use a rsrc7486, obtained from the rsrc303, to cosmetically enhance their lava battlestaff, creating a rsrc7481. This only alters its appearance, and becomes untradeable.

    "article-text": "The leaf-bladed sword is one of three melee weapons used to harm rsrc975 and rsrc614, the other being the rsrc7502 and rsrc5414. The sword requires an rsrc28 level of 50 and a rsrc285 level of 55 to wield. It is a good alternative to the rsrc7502 as it attacks faster, has higher rsrc15936 and rsrc15937 bonuses, and is one-handed, enabling the use of a rsrc15904 or rsrc1898 if required. It is dropped by turoths and kurasks, both located in the rsrc7501. Players with an Attack level of 65 are greatly encouraged to use a rsrc5414 instead, as it has a 17.5% damage buff against turoths and kurasks, apart from having better stats than the sword counterpart.  The rsrc639 is one of the most popular weapons in rsrc15920; it is a fast, one-handed weapon with decent strength and accuracy. rsrc633 are also considered to be much better than regular swords of the same metal. For example, rsrc364 are better than rsrc662 in both accuracy and strength but equal in speed. The leaf-bladed sword is considered a good substitute for the dragon sword. It has a lower strength bonus than the scimitar just as it is with other metals, but the attack bonuses are identical, making the leaf-bladed sword more useful in certain circumstances than other swords would be. The leaf-bladed sword's stab bonus of 67 is the same as the dragon scimitar's slash bonus of 67. Because the two weapons share the same attack speed and accuracy, the leaf-bladed sword is a more accurate option for killing monsters that are weak against stab attacks, such as rsrc5538 or rsrc5516. When coupled with any rsrc1898, the leaf-bladed sword will surpass the dragon scimitar in overall stats due to the additional stab bonus granted by the defender. For example, a leaf-bladed sword and rsrc250 will have a stab bonus of 92 while the dragon scimitar and dragon defender will have a slash bonus of 91. The difference is small, but may be more useful for long-term training. With a defender, the leaf-bladed sword is more accurate than the dragon scimitar, does not require the completion of a Master quest (rsrc47), and only requires 50 Attack to wield. However, the strength bonus of the scimitar is 66 while the sword has only 50 (76% of the scimitar's bonus): at 99 Strength and wielding only the weapons, a leaf-bladed sword can hit 21 while the dragon scimitar can hit 24. The leaf-bladed sword also lacks a special attack (though most players agree the dragon scimitar's rsrc15915 is not very useful outside PvP worlds or PvP activities) and requires 55 rsrc285 to wield. The leaf-bladed sword does have the advantage of being a strong weapon against rsrc975 or rsrc614, and having a lower price. If slash must be used, other weapon such as a dragon scimitar or an rsrc252 would be preferred. ",

Players require level 30 attack and level 30 Thieving to equip and use one of these. To obtain one, the player must have completed the blackjack section of the rsrc4894. When the blackjacks are set to 'offensive', one will be able to buy the Maple blackjack(o) from Ali Morrisane. There are three NPCs that can be lured/knocked out with this blackjack: Villagers, Bandits and Menaphite Thugs, all located in Pollnivneach. The Thieving levels required to lure these are 30, 45 and 65 respectively.  When fighting with a blackjack there is a slight chance to rsrc3080 the opponent. First, the player uses the Lure function of the blackjack to lead the unsuspecting NPC to a remote place, and can then knock out the NPC. Once unconscious, the player can pickpocket the victim a maximum of two times before the NPC regains consciousness. ",

It can be bought from rsrc6019, the rsrc884 seller on rsrc1256, for 1,000 coins or you can get another one for free from the rsrc8065. During rsrc47, one of these is obtained from the monkey child. He asks for 20 bananas in exchange for it, but you only have to give him 4-10, because he can't count. To get another monkey talisman after that, talk to him again. First you will tell him that you lost it and he will start to cry. You can either log out of the game, or wait for around a minute (watch out for rsrc8066 or use a greegree) and then he will cheer up, allowing you to take another one. You can get as many as you want this way. There are 8 different types of greegrees you can craft. To turn it into a greegree, you must kill any type of monkey (not a rsrc2669; their bones can't be made into a greegree), pick up the bones and bring them with the monkey talisman to Zooknock, who is located at the end of rsrc16604. Go down the ladder, south of the atoll, and follow the long and dangerous maze to the other end of the tunnel. It is recommended that you have level 43 rsrc81 for rsrc1264. It is also a good idea to bring rsrc1044 and/or rsrc1045. Use the talisman and bones on Zooknock and you will obtain a greegree. Note: You may get other talismans other than just a normal rsrc5922. You can kill a rsrc16605 or a rsrc16606, or if you'd like to be a gorilla, kill a rsrc2381. Bring their bones and a talisman to Zooknock. An excellent strategy is to get all the Greegrees after you get your first greegree (the Karamjan monkey greegree). You can then get more monkey talismans, either from the store or the rsrc16607. Then, sneak up behind any monkey while still in monkey form. (As long as you are in monkey form, the monkeys will not attack you). Then, quickly change into human form and attack the monkey. It is possible to avoid all damage until you reach the monkey and start attacking it. If you want to use melee bring good armour, combat potions, antipoisons, prayer potions, and a good weapon. If using ranged bring your corresponding dragon hide armour, ranged potions and/or prayer potions, your corresponding crossbow, and iron or higher bolts are recommended. If using mage then bring fire spell runes, the same potions as before, and good armour that gives a magic bonus and a good melee defence bonus against the Monkey Guards, or good ranged bonus against the Monkey Archers. While wielding a Monkey Greegree, it appears that when using the rsrc454 from the rsrc16608 to cure rsrc296, no rsrc16129 will be used.  ",

To make a ninja greegree, a player must take monkey bones from a Ninja Monkey and a rsrc16503 to rsrc2379. There are two different ninja greegrees. This is made using bones from rsrc8057 or rsrc8058, rsrc16616, rsrc16617 or rsrc16618 summoned by rsrc1256 residents (level 149), although players don't have to kill the summoned ones (rsrc8269 kills them). However, getting these from killing Padulah directly is recommended as it is much simpler. There is a glitch if you get caught and you try to switch back to your monkey form, there is a small chance you will lose your greegree. However this glitch is not common. The rsrc8268 does NOT summon guards. While it is possible to kill summoned guards for the bones, Padulah could be killed without hassle and is strongly recommended. If the monkeys touch the player they send them to jail. While players are hiding the 10th Squad Assassin kills the monkey. Walk back out as a monkey and take the bones. Beware, if more than one monkey appears, he only kills one of the monkeys. Players should wield the greegree to avoid being attacked by the other ones, or relog after rsrc8269 has killed a monkey. However, a player should be aware that a greegree cannot be wielded if they are in combat. Also, since an NPC killed the monkey, anyone can take the bones immediately. Another option is that players can run into the grass behind the shop and put the greegree back on. When players come back rsrc8269 will have killed the monkey. If players insist on killing summoned guards, a much more reliable method for high levels is to summon them by talking to rsrc8054. The guards would often become stuck behind jungle plants and they could be safely rsrc78 or rsrc59. Be quick, as they disappear soon. Overall there are 8 greegrees, including the large and small ninja greegrees, large and small zombie greegrees, bearded, blue faced and normal gorilla greegrees and the Karamjan greegrees. The greegree is mainly used in rsrc7314, or training agility at the rsrc2080. The small ninja greegree (from rsrc8059) can be used to access said course quickly without having to use runes or the gnomes to travel to Ape Atoll, by using the rsrc16021 CLR The medium ninja greegree cannot be used for the shortcut.

While equipped, players can right-click the sword in the rsrc26 interface to perform an emote, in which players assume a fencing position and slash the air to create the letters \"RS\", the acronym for \"RuneScape\". Despite being a sword, its combat styles are the same as those of a rsrc671. It offers very large attack penalties and is nearly useless as an actual weapon. As such, it is allowed during \"fun weapon\" fights in the rsrc1816. When wielded, a \"Slash\" option will appear on other players. Picking this option will cause the player to slash their target. The hit is just an animation and no damage is dealt, nor does it count as entering combat. There is a chance that players may \"fumble\" the sword, dropping it to the ground where it must be picked up. ",

This requires 63 rsrc1887, and will give the player 265 Hunter experience per catch. They can also be caught in the rsrc8868 after completing the hard rsrc1255. They can be teleported to by using the Fairy ring code A-K-S near the Feldip Hills hunter area. To use chinchompas in rsrc712, they must be wielded in the rsrc358 rsrc16520. Red chinchompas are thrown like rsrc16474 or rsrc16507; however, they explode on impact. They can hit up to 9 targets in a 3x3 area. They cannot be picked up again from the ground after being thrown and rsrc3213 does not return them. Throwing a chin at a group determines the hit for the whole group, so if the chin hits a 0 on one member of the group, it will hit a 0 on all of them; if it hits a 10 on one member, it will hit within that range of all members of the group. Using red chinchompas is widely regarded as the second fastest way to train Ranged and rsrc65; however, this method is very costly. Catching red chinchompas is also popular among high-level Hunters as it gives fast experience and is profitable. Attack speed: Fuses are used to describe the attack speed for throwing chinchompas. It is just another name for the conventional styles of ranged training. Short fuse: 4 ticks Medium fuse: 3 ticks Long fuse: 4 ticks Note: If a player dies with red chinchompas in their inventory or equipped, the chinchompas will disappear and cannot be retrieved. This is due to the fact that the chinchompa is a live animal, meaning it can run away. However, if you are in the rsrc464 and die, the player who killed you can pick up your chinchompas.  Using red chinchompas is a practical way of training rsrc78 and rsrc65 due to the fact that experience rates are based on DPS (damage per second). This causes high demand for them, and thus are generally expensive. These are commonly used for training on rsrc2669. The rsrc4371 works with chinning on rsrc277 creatures because chinchompas ignore the rsrc30 of the targets surrounding the primary target and only uses the primary target's Defence in determining if you hit everyone or none.  Chinchompas were actually inspired by the rsrc16509.",

The Rubber chicken can be equipped and has the same attack styles as a rsrc671. It gives very large attack penalties and is nearly useless as an actual weapon. As such it is allowed during \"fun weapon\" fights in the rsrc1816. When wielded, players will see a \"Whack\" option on all other players. Picking that option will cause the player to hit the other player. The hit is just an animation and no damage is dealt, nor does it count as entering combat. If a player whacks a large number of other players, they may \"fumble\" the chicken, dropping it to the ground where it must be picked up again and re-equipped. Players can right click the chicken, either in their rsrc424 or on the rsrc1390 screen, and select a dance option, making them do the chicken dance emote, which includes a short song. The dance and song could also be accessed by eating one of the event's Easter eggs, however once the event was concluded, this method no longer worked. Players who distract the eyes in the rsrc257 will sometimes perform the Chicken Dance emote, even if they do not have a Rubber chicken. Before the rsrc3891, it could only be obtained from picking one up from various spawn points around the world during 12\u201319 August 2013. When picked up by a player, it would immediately spawn in another random location.  ",

Another alternative that is considerably more expensive, but slightly better for training, is the rsrc3528, giving +2 for both strength and slash. Players who have completed rsrc1336 may also use the rsrc1337, which has a higher strength bonus than the rune scimitar and attacks at the same speed, however primarily attacks with crush or magic, rather than slash.  The rune scimitar matches the rsrc356 strength bonus, and is much faster, whilst having a marginally higher slash bonus.",

To wield a rune throwing axe the player must have at least 40 Ranged. They can be purchased from the rsrc666 at the rsrc555.  The rune thrownaxe has a rsrc15915, Chainhit, that ricochets off the target and hits multiple other opponents in a multi-combat area. This can target up to 5 opponents. Each hit consumes 10% of the player's special attack energy. For example: 3 hits consumes 30%, while 5 hits consume 50%. Many players use this in rsrc1599 as an efficient way of reaching the rsrc1475. This is because with a pet rock and the rune thrownaxe, the player can make their way to the dungeon's sub-levels without a need of a partner. When used on the middle barricade support, the rune thrownaxe's special attack will destroy all three barricade supports without having to have another player attack it from the opposite side. To prevent obsolescence, the special attack of rune throwing axes was introduced some time after their initial release.",

Crafted by rsrc16630 himself and given to rsrc1574 as a gift for her assistance in the rsrc16631, it is only available as a rare drop from the rsrc1573. The staff has a built-in magic spell that can be used regardless of the rsrc1640 the player is using, although it cannot be used to autocast any other combat spells. The spell gives no base experience and grants the player 2 rsrc59 experience per damage dealt. In addition, the spell possesses a healing rsrc1673 in which rsrc813 have a 1 in 6 chance of healing the wielder half the amount of rsrc65 dealt to a target. The spell cannot be used against other players in the rsrc464. The only way that the spell can be used against other players is during the rsrc430 and rsrc9193 rsrc15988, as well as the rsrc5868 minigame if the clan leaders enable it.  In order to use the staff's magic spell, it must be charged with rsrc1137, holding up to 20,000 charges when fully charged. Each cast requires 3 blood runes, costing 1,026 coins per cast, and 20,520,000 coins to fully charge it with 60,000 blood runes. Compared to the rsrc1361, the built-in spell hits one damage higher with a maximum base damage of 34 compared to the trident of the swamp's 33. The trident possesses the ability to rsrc1342, while the staff possesses the healing passive effect. Thus, the staff is most optimal in situations where venom or poison has no benefit, and where healing is required. However, if the player's target is not immune to venom, players could initially use the trident of the swamp against the target until the target has been envenomed, then switch to the Sanguinesti staff. Notable encounters where the staff's healing capability proves very useful include the rsrc1483, the rsrc1178 and rsrc393. 75 rsrc28 75 rsrc28 75 rsrc28 40 rsrc59 rsrc28 (Mystic) 50 rsrc28 50 rsrc28 55 rsrc285 30 rsrc59 rsrc28 (Battlestaff) 40 rsrc59 rsrc28 (Mystic)  ",

It is first obtained during the quest rsrc3312, where it is used to defeat rsrc9484. During rsrc2704, Silverlight is dyed black using rsrc2660, and later becomes rsrc1321 after it is stained with the blood of rsrc16530. If it is lost, it can be bought back from rsrc1607 for 500gp at rsrc16635. It can also be sold to the rsrc3109 for 80gp. It is possible to obtain multiple Silverlight swords by rsrc1731 and buying more, or by getting it rsrc9485 in a rsrc156 at level 42 rsrc289. As the name implies, it is made out of silver and therefore is effective against rsrc16636. Warning: Dying Silverlight black will consume all copies of the sword in your inventory, leaving you with only one dyed sword. You will need to bank or drop any extra swords before dying one. Warning: After completion of Shadow of the Storm, Silverlight becomes unobtainable. Sir Prysin will instead sell rsrc1321 for 1000 coins.   The dyed black version of the sword can be created at any point after Shadow of the Storm, provided the player obtained multiple Silverlight swords using the drop trick.

    "article-text": "The Skull Sceptre is obtained by combining untradeable items dropped by monsters residing within the rsrc3405. Its defining feature is the ability to rsrc16098 to the entrance of the stronghold located in rsrc594 and consumes a charge in doing so.  Once all nine charges have been consumed, the sceptre will self-destruct. The sceptre can be upgraded to contain seven charges by completing the easy rsrc2343 and upgraded further to hold nine charges once the medium Varrock Diary is completed. It is also possible to imbue the sceptre by showing Solzton, who is at the bottom of the Stronghold, your reward from the Cradle of Life while having the sceptre in your inventory. This prevents the item from being destroyed and allows it to be recharged with sceptre pieces. It is possible to keep track of the charges by using the \"Divine\" option when the sceptre is in your inventory.  Each piece has a 3% chance of being dropped by the following monsters: Note: Players can only make and keep one skull sceptre at a time. A new skull sceptre can only be made once the old one is either lost or destroyed; however, players can create more strange skulls and runed sceptres as well as keep multiples of the component parts. If players have the rsrc9530 active on their account, they can show the completed sceptre and a pair of rsrc6043 or rsrc6045 (They do not need to be in your inventory to imbue, simply click \"Is this the treasure\"?) to rsrc9532, found at the very end of the Stronghold, to have him create a rsrc9531. While imbued, it will not break upon depleting all its charges. It can be recharged with sceptre pieces: each piece will grant three teleport charges, and the combined pieces (strange skull and runed sceptre) will grant six charges. The maximum charges a sceptre can hold is 5, or 9 if the player has completed both easy and medium parts of the rsrc2343. This benefit to carry over to F2P, even if you no longer are a member. Warning: Should players disable the Authenticator, the sceptre will revert back to its regular state. Also, should players die with skull sceptre, it will be destroyed and cannot be retrieved. ",

Once the charges run out, it will revert back to a regular Slayer's staff, and an additional Slayer's enchantment must be used on it. Using the staff substantially increases the damage dealt by the Magic Dart spell when attacking a monster the player is rsrc3482 to kill. Specifically, the rsrc16637 of the spell when using the slayer's staff (e) becomes $ (MagicLevel/6) + 13 $, rounded down. This stacks with other magic-damage boosts like the rsrc57, rsrc9556, and rsrc2785/rsrc286. When used to attack a monster that is not your slayer assignment, no charges will be used, and the damage of Slayer Dart will not be boosted. Splashing on task will also cause no charges to be used.  The rsrc16637 dealt by the staff is dependent on the player's current rsrc59 level, starting at 25 with level 75 Magic, up to a maximum of 31 at level 108 (with an rsrc7061). Both magic damage bonuses and stat boosts will modify the max hit of the spell; likewise, stat-reductions will lower the damage. With an rsrc57 equipped, the maximum hit possible is 34.

They may also be obtained by operating a rsrc3893 and rsrc9609, obtained during rsrc2806. Contrary to common belief, snowballs will not \"melt\" after Christmas events.  The snowball must be equipped in order to throw it at other players or Gublinchs. Normally, players can simply left click on other players to throw a snowball at them however in PVP areas and/or minigames (if possible to do so in the minigame) players must right click the other player and select \"pelt\". When players throw a snowball or have a snowball thrown at them, the damaged in combat sound effect plays. This can cause afk players to become alert and believe they are being attacked. Despite being equipped in the weapon slot, the snowball can be taken to rsrc1106 because it doesn't boost any stats. Seemingly contradicting, snowballs can also be taken into rsrc430 and is not considered a non-weapon. If taken into the desert, snowballs will not melt (even when the player is without a waterskin). If a player brings snowballs into a Castle Wars waiting for game lobby, they are able to throw snowballs at other players. You are unable to throw snowballs at other players inside the minigame, however. It can be thrown at other players in the wilderness, however this will not cause damage. The snowballs \"attack\" is the same punch/kick as the character would attacking something completely unequipped, simply they are holding snowballs. The easiest way to get a large amount snowballs is to wait until the yearly Christmas event because, due to the snow on the ground, you do not need to repetitively summon snow with the rsrc3893 or Snow globe as you can simply click on a pile of snow and all that is required is for the player to keep themselves logged in. As of the 2016 Christmas Event, piles of snow are now located in Falador Park throughout the event. A good strategy for collecting snowballs, much like splashing, is to get a Gardner to attack you, causing the player to be logged in for an extended period of time. If a player is performing an emote or skillcape emote and is attacked with a snowball, the emote is interrupted and the player staggers as they would if they were hit in combat. If a player is riding the magic carpet and is attacked with a snowball, a temporary graphics glitch occurs in which it appears the player on the carpet momentarily walks on the ground. If a player is teleporting and is attacked with a snowball, the sound effect and snowball reach the target nonetheless. The snowball will completely reverse its direction of travel in order to hit a teleporting player. If a player is standing in a building and closes the door while a snowball is thrown at them, the snowball and sound effect still reaches the player inside. If a player \"changes rooms\" or enters a dungeon while a snowball is thrown at them, the snowball and sound effect still reaches the player \"changing rooms.\" If a player enters the castle wars waiting for game lobby as an imp/sheep/bunny, they are able to throw snowballs at other players if they enter the lobby with snowballs already equipped. At the Duel Arena, players in the stands can throw snowballs at players in arena. Players in the arena can likewise throw snowballs at players in the stands. However, players in the stands can throw rotten tomatoes at players in the arena, whereas players in the arena cannot throw rotten tomatoes at players in the stands. Because of this, many players will bring snowballs with them into the arena to return fire from players throwing rotten tomatoes (or snowballs) at them from the stands. Players in the arena may also throw snowballs at other players in the arena (but not rotten tomatoes), and, being a projectile, can be thrown over the obstacle walls. Players in the arena often bring snowballs into the duel arena to fire at or return fire from other players snowballs or attacks. It is possible for a player in the arena to throw a snowball at a player standing near the hospital/bank area of the duel arena, a potential graphics glitch in that the player appears to throw a snowball through a wall.

It is dropped by rsrc381, and counts as a rsrc15926 while in the rsrc467 and in the desert rsrc4110. It is one of the few items that boosts the player's magic damage, boosting it by 15%. When a combat spell is cast with the staff, there is a 12.5% (1/8) chance that the staff will negate the rune cost for that spell. The staff can be substituted for a rsrc1350 for casting rsrc1366 (and is more accurate than a Slayer's staff), and can autocast rsrc837 and rsrc825. The staff is notable for its offensive melee stats, which are unusually high for a Magic weapon. Its stats are comparable to the rsrc90; the longsword has 3+ better stab bonuses, but the staff has +1 better slash and strength bonus in addition to the magic damage boost, accuracy, and a faster attack speed. The staff of the dead offers an attack speed of 6 when using melee, which is the same as weapons such as the rsrc252. However, when using magic spells, it offers an attack speed of 5, which is the same as all spells, except for the rsrc1354 or rsrc1361.  The staff has a rsrc15915, Power of Death, that halves all rsrc507 damage of your opponent(s) (all opponents that hit you in the time of the special attack) for one minute at a cost of 100% special attack energy. This effect stacks with the PvP damage reduction effect of the rsrc1264 rsrc81, but is lost if the staff is unequipped. The special attack cannot be used in the rsrc1816 if magic is disabled. Players with level 59 rsrc263 can attach a rsrc7721 to the staff using a rsrc965, creating a rsrc1364. This enhances its magic attack bonus by +8, and has the ability to infect a target with rsrc1342. However, taking advantage of these benefits requires using rsrc1344 to charge the staff. Targets can only be infected with rsrc1342 while using a magic attack, but using both melee and magic attacks will consume rsrc1344. Alternatively, players can use rsrc9244 on the staff of the dead to create the rsrc1360, which inherits the effects of the staff of the dead. This process is irreversible. The only differences between the two staves is that the staff of light is able to autocast rsrc877 instead of rsrc837, and it counts as a Saradominist item while in the rsrc467 and in the rsrc4110. 75 rsrc28 75 rsrc28 75 rsrc28 40 rsrc59 rsrc28 (Mystic) 50 rsrc28 50 rsrc28 55 rsrc285 30 rsrc59 rsrc28 (Battlestaff) 40 rsrc59 rsrc28 (Mystic)   rsrc3266 appears to wield the staff.

If a player dies with the staff and it is not one of the player's protected items, the staff will revert to its default appearance, and players must use another steam staff upgrade kit to enhance its appearance again.   The model for this item was originally polled as a graphical update for the rsrc1367 in Content Poll #22. It gained 69.9% yes votes, 5.1% short of the passing threshold required. The model was then polled as a cosmetic upgrade kit in the Old School Bounty Hunter Rewards 2 poll, and passed by 79.6%.",

It also has a powerful rsrc1673 within the rsrc464 when charged with rsrc3478. Thammaron's sceptre is a magical rsrc10006 once owned by rsrc6579, a Tsutsaroth rsrc15909 who was once one of rsrc1220's most trusted allies during the rsrc1224.

It also has a powerful rsrc1673 within the rsrc464 when charged with rsrc3478.                         When Thammaron's sceptre is charged with rsrc3478, an additional 100% magic accuracy and 25% magic damage boost is applied when attacking any rsrc15930 in the rsrc464, consuming 1 ether per attack whether the player hits or not. This effect will stack with a rsrc282 or a rsrc1086 and their variants, but not both simultaneously. This makes the sceptre the best magic weapon in the Wilderness, surpassing the damage output of a rsrc1354 (and its rsrc1361) with the additional capability of attacking any hostile players, something which both tridents are incapable of doing. In order to use the sceptre's passive effect, it must first be activated with 1,000 rsrc3478 (costing 102,000). The 1,000 ether used to activate the sceptre does not count towards the usage of the passive effect, thus additional ether must be added (up to 16,000) in order to increase the sceptre's damage output. The ether can be safely removed by selecting the right-click Uncharge option on the sceptre, after which the sceptre becomes tradeable again. Upon death within the Wilderness, any revenant ether stored within the sceptre will always be lost, even if it is one of the player's protected items. Because of this, despite the sceptre being able to store a maximum of 17,000 revenant ether, it is recommended to store the minimum amount required for a trip into the Wilderness (in addition to the 1,000 ether required to activate the weapon).  Upon release, Thammaron's sceptre had a starting rsrc490 price of 10,000,000 coins. This was manually adjusted to 20,000,000 coins on 1 August after frequent rsrc14113 in the Wilderness via dropping items whose prices on the Grand Exchange were more than the sceptre itself. As the game prioritises the protection of items that have the highest price on the Grand Exchange, the player may end up losing the sceptre by picking up an item worth slightly more than the sceptre on the Grand Exchange, which was worth around 45 million coins at the time.",

An uncharged trident is dropped by the normal cave krakens, while the boss kraken can drop a fully charged trident. Similar to rsrc807, the trident is only tradeable when either uncharged or fully charged. The staff has a built-in magic spell that can be used regardless of the rsrc1640 the player is using, although it cannot be used to autocast any other combat spells. The spell gives no base experience and grants the player 2 rsrc59 experience per damage dealt. The spell cannot be used against other players in the rsrc464. The only way that the spell can be used against other players is during the rsrc430 and rsrc9193 rsrc15988, as well as the rsrc5868 minigame if the clan leaders enable it.  In order to use the trident's magic spell, it must be charged with various rsrc884, holding up to 2,500 charges when fully charged. Charging the trident requires level 75 Magic. Each cast requires 1 rsrc1627, 1 rsrc3694, 5 rsrc839 and 10 rsrc321, costing 419 per cast. A fully charged staff costs 1,047,500 total: 2,500 death runes, 2,500 chaos runes, 12,500 fire runes and 25,000 coins. Any remaining charges within the trident can be removed at anytime to recover the rsrc884; however, the coins will not be refunded. If a player rsrc2672 with the trident, only the uncharged trident will appear on the floor (if it's not rsrc1877). The max hit dealt by the trident is dependent on the player's current rsrc59 level, starting at 20 with level 75 Magic and increasing by one every three Magic levels, up to a maximum of 31 at level 108 (obtainable only through rsrc9844 in a rsrc238 dream or with the rsrc7061). Both magic damage bonuses and stat boosts will modify the max hit of the spell; likewise, stat-reductions will lower the damage, but the minimum max hit will never fall below 20, even if the player's Magic level is reduced below 75. Players can give an uncharged trident and 10 rsrc297 to rsrc7424 to create an rsrc10116, which holds 20,000 charges instead of 2,500. Players with level 59 rsrc263 can attach a rsrc7721 to the trident using a rsrc965, creating a rsrc1361. This enhances its magic attack bonus, and has the ability to infect a target with rsrc1342. However, to take advantage of those benefits requires using rsrc1344 instead of coins to charge the trident.

It is made by using a rsrc7721 on an uncharged rsrc1354 with a rsrc965, requiring 59 rsrc263 to do so. Unlike its predecessor, it is only tradeable when uncharged. The staff has a built-in magic spell that can be used regardless of the rsrc1640 the player is using, although it cannot be used to autocast any other combat spells. The spell gives no base experience and grants the player 2 rsrc59 experience per damage dealt. In addition, the spell possesses a rsrc1673 in which rsrc813 have a 25% chance of inflicting rsrc1342 on their opponent. If the player is wearing a rsrc2451, the chance is increased to 100%. Like all trident-class weapons, the spell cannot be used against other players in the rsrc464. The only way that the spell can be used against other players is during the rsrc430 and rsrc9193 rsrc15988, as well as the rsrc5868 minigame if the clan leaders enable it.

In order to use the trident's magic spell, it must be charged with various rsrc884, holding up to 2,500 charges when fully charged. Charging the trident requires level 75 Magic. Each cast requires 1 rsrc1627, 1 rsrc3694, 5 rsrc839 and 1 rsrc16652, costing 671 per cast, and 1,677,500 coins to fully charge it. Any remaining charges within the trident can be removed at anytime to recover the rsrc884. If a player rsrc2672 with the trident, any scales that were used to charge it will appear on the floor along with the uncharged trident (if it's not rsrc1877). The rsrc16637 dealt by the trident is dependent on the player's current rsrc59 level, starting at 23 with level 75 Magic and increasing by one every three Magic levels, up to a maximum of 33 at level 105 (obtainable only through rsrc9844 in a rsrc238 dream, or with an rsrc7061). Both magic damage bonuses and stat boosts will modify the max hit of the spell; likewise, stat-reductions will lower the damage. With an rsrc57 equipped, the maximum hit possible is 36. With an occult necklace, a rsrc9556, and an rsrc286 on a rsrc3482, the maximum hit possible is 41.

It also has a powerful rsrc1673 within the rsrc464 when charged with rsrc3478.                         When Viggora's chainmace is charged with rsrc3478, an additional 50% melee accuracy and damage boost is applied when attacking any rsrc15930 in the rsrc464, consuming 1 ether per attack whether the player hits or not. This effect will stack with a rsrc282 or a rsrc1086 and their variants, but not both simultaneously. This makes it the best melee weapon in the Wilderness, surpassing the damage output of an rsrc5315 with the attack speed of an rsrc252. In order to use the chainmace's passive effect, it must first be activated with 1,000 rsrc3478 (costing 102,000). The 1,000 ether used to activate the chainmace does not count towards the usage of the passive effect, thus additional ether must be added (up to 16,000) in order to increase the chainmace's damage output. The ether can be safely removed by selecting the right-click Uncharge option on the chainmace, after which the chainmace becomes tradeable again. Upon death within the Wilderness, any revenant ether stored within the chainmace will always be lost, even if it is one of the player's protected items. Because of this, despite the chainmace being able to store a maximum of 17,000 revenant ether, it is recommended to store the minimum amount required for a trip into the Wilderness (in addition to the 1,000 ether required to activate the weapon).  Upon release, Viggora's chainmace had a starting rsrc490 price of 10,000,000 coins. This was manually adjusted to 100,000,000 coins on 1 August after frequent rsrc14113 in the Wilderness via dropping items whose prices on the Grand Exchange were more than the chainmace itself. As the game prioritises the protection of items that have the highest price on the Grand Exchange, the player may end up losing the chainmace by picking up an item worth slightly more than the chainmace on the Grand Exchange, which was worth around 250 million coins at the time.",

This mace is unique because, even though it is a melee weapon, it can be used to auto-cast the rsrc878 spell. This weapon is slightly better than a rsrc9014, with an additional +2 for Stab, Slash, and Crush Attack; +2 Stab, Slash, Crush, Magic and Ranged Defence; +2 Strength; +2 Prayer; and +8 Magic Attack. This makes it one of the only melee weapons in game to have a positive ranged defence bonus, other than the rsrc7705 and rsrc5561, with +1, and the rsrc5523 and rsrc5525, with +5 and +13, respectively. To cast Claws of Guthix, the player still must have cast the spell 100 times in the Wilderness rsrc4903. Note that the Void Knight mace does not count towards the four pieces needed for the void set effect.  ",

The whip may be made tradeable again by using a rsrc304 on the volcanic abyssal whip, returning the whip back to normal, however the whip mix will not be retained. The whip counts as a piece of warm clothing when battling the rsrc348. Note: Despite being untradeable, if the volcanic abyssal whip is not one of your protected items upon dying to another player in the rsrc464, it will be lost upon death. Even below level 20 Wilderness, the whip will lose its paint and drop to the ground for the person who killed you.   The volcanic abyssal whip seems to have an animation similar to that of the rsrc6107, making it one of the few animated pieces of equipment in rsrc1469. Like the fire cape, the animation will continue if the whip is dropped on the floor. The inventory sprite and the actual appearance of the volcanic abyssal whip differ; when it is equipped the \"links\" are black, whereas the inventory sprite has orange links.",

    "article-text": "The Zamorak banner is the standard of Team rsrc1220 in the rsrc430 rsrc15988, in which players on Team Zamorak must defend the Zamorak banner while players on Team rsrc1222 attempt to capture it and return it to their base to score points. The flag can be passed to another player if it is dropped. It can be bought from the rsrc4204 shop, owned by rsrc1883 for 100 rsrc4203. The Zamorak banner is a large red standard bearing the symbol of Zamorak, a black W-shaped fork, attached to a long wooden pole. If captured, the player doing so will automatically switch his current weapon and shield with the standard, which is held with both hands. Players can attack with the standard, but it is very weak weapon without any accuracy or strength bonuses. If a player with the standard is killed, the standard will be dropped on the ground, allowing it to be taken by members of either team.  ",
