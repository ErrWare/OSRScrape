    "article-text": "A Non-player character, or NPC, is a rsrc10513 not controlled by a rsrc16059. As such, NPCs are computer-controlled characters with pre-defined functions, paths, and methods to enhance players' immersion to the game. Players can usually talk to NPCs, but they are not attackable. (If they are attackable, they are considered rsrc597.) They include store owners, rsrc15898 contacts, rsrc2155 and civilians. NPCs can give out quests, sell items, restrict access to certain areas and perform other vital duties. Many have no useful function, but provide atmosphere or interesting conversation. Some can talk in public, but this will not appear in the chat list. NPCs names have a yellow colour on the minimap. NPCs form the foundations for quests: beginning them, continuing the story, giving information and handing out rewards and items. In RuneScape Classic, NPCs could only talk to one rsrc16059 at a time. Some players took advantage of this and talked to NPCs and did not respond, thereby preventing access to the shops. In RuneScape Classic, players who stood in the same spot for five minutes would automatically be logged out, but this rule didn't apply when players were talking to NPCs. Some players also did this with new rsrc15898 too. rsrc2868 changed the system so that if a player doesn't respond to an NPC when others are waiting the conversation would automatically end. If a rsrc16059 blocks the path for an NPC for too long, the NPC will reset to its \"respawn\" location. This is especially noticeable for rsrc11743 near the rsrc1461. Technically, anything with a yellow name is an NPC. However, usually only those that represent actual characters rather than things like rsrc16668 are referred to as such. If a space is occupied by a player or an NPC, another player may walk through them without their path being blocked, but an NPC cannot walk onto or over a space occupied by a player or another NPC. Not all NPCs can be walked through. The first NPC rsrc2868 created was rsrc11743."

In addition, if the player uses a rsrc470 on 50% Luke, Luke will get angry and \"hit a 500 hit combo\" on the player. When Luke fell overboard, he was thrown a rope by his crew, which he clung to as the ship continued on its course. When the ship passed over The Other 50% Reef, Luke was caught on the spiky coral, which mutilated the left side of his body. The reef was then given its name by The Inebriated's crew and is still labelled so on their maps today.  When first talking to 50% Luke, you ask him if he is \"All Right\", indicating he has no left side of his body. Luke is much like a cyborg, a human with mechanical implants in its body. During the rsrc2969 quest, when 50% Luke says, \"Do you expect me to talk?\", players will reply, \"No Mr. Luke. I expect you to die!\" - a reference to the James Bond movie. When the character asks 50% Luke for his story, Luke will say \"Well, it all starts with an albatross...\", this is a reference to the poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner by the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge in which the main character of the poem kills an albatross and ends up cursing the crew and leaving them in an undead state, similar to the state Luke is in. Pirates in fiction are often depicted with missing or substitute body parts (peg legs, hook-hands, eye patches, etc). 50% Luke is an extreme example of this, as he is missing 50% of his body."

Due to the player's actions in the rsrc4106 rsrc15898, he is freed from Enakhra's control and chases her to The North. The camels of the deep desert are presumed to be named after him. After the events of the quest he is most likely one of the few Mahjarrat friendly to the player, such as rsrc4341 (if the player resurrected him) and rsrc10712. The time period after Zaros and Zamorak's banishment was tumultuous, and saw the defection of most of Zaros' servants to the cause of Zamorak. Akthanakos was one of few to remain loyal to the Empty Lord, not only creating a schism between the respective Mahjarrat factions, but also intensifying the hatred between Akthanakos and his rival Enakhra, who had become infatuated with Zamorak. Some time after the betrayal of Zaros, but before Zamorak returned to Gielinor and started the rsrc1224, Akthanakos was surprised when Enakhra contacted him, apparently repentant of her betrayal of the Empty Lord and wanting to switch sides. Meeting in a rsrc1094 while Zamorak was still mortal, Enakhra pretended to discuss this apparent change of heart, however Akthanakos soon discovered to his shock and horror that he had been deceived; Enakhra's supposed defection was but a ruse to lure her rival to the temple and entrap him there forever. To this end, Akthanakos was transformed into a lowly rsrc2508 to serve Enakhra, and would remain in this form for thousands of years, at the mercy of his great foe. With his disappearance, his camel followers became much more violent. Thousands of years after being imprisoned, freedom came to Akthanakos in the year 169 of the rsrc2390 in the form of an adventurer. Enakhra's temple, and the Mahjarrat herself, had long since disappeared beneath the sands of the desert, yet there were still those who knew of its existence, such as the Zamorakian mage rsrc4120, who sought Enakhra and the knowledge she would no doubt have. To this end, he posed as a humble sculptor, and manipulated an adventurer into helping him build a statue, due to now being unable to do so himself. Upon completion of the statue however, the dune upon which it stood caved in, revealing the tunnels of the temple below. Lazim's true intentions revealed, the adventurer was then hired to explore the temple thoroughly, and in doing so, received odd visions about the temple's history, including Enakhra's entrapment of Akthanakos. Eventually, after solving the temple's puzzles, the adventurer came across the final chamber, guarded by Akthanakos in his Bone guard form. After a brief encounter, Akthanakos beseeched the adventurer to free him from his incarceration by sealing Enakhra away behind the nearby wall. This allowed for Enakhra's hold over Akthanakos to break, and for the first time in millennia, assume his camel-headed form. Enakhra however would not be held, shattering the adventurer's hard work, but Akthanakos' request had been granted. The two rivals, now in a struggle again, transformed back into their skeletal forms and vowed to destroy one another, before both heading off to the North, where they would continue their fight.  Akthanakos' name might have been derived from the Greek word Athanatos, meaning \"immortal\" or \"without death\"."

He is located on the market in north-eastern part of rsrc625 not far from the cactus patch. He will often sell useless junk to players without the player's consent. He was born in Pollnivneach and is prejudiced by the citizens of rsrc625 because of this. He is often called a lowlife for his greedy deeds and was put in an unknown prison for 5 years. His known family members are his son rsrc16695 and nephew Ali Baba (who may not actually exist). He wrote a very basic guide on how to kill things, which can be read in the Varrock dummy training area by the east bank. It is also said in rsrc16696 that he drove rsrc1325 from unknown parts to rsrc3526. Despite owning a small stall, he seems to be very rich, employing many people and devising large schemes and scams that make him richer. Appearing harmless, Ali is a brilliant businessman who crosses all limits when trying to achieve his goal. After having an adventurer settle a feud between bandits and Menaphites that follow rsrc4145 in his home town, he \"invites\" a number of his nephew's acquaintances to Al Kharid to set up business. In reality, this farmer, tailor, smith and guard (Ali, Ali, Ali and Ali respectively)'s jobs are to threaten all of the town's shopkeepers, or rather, anyone who offers services or goods for payment, to join Ali's chain of business or have theirs taken down. Nevertheless, the shopkeepers of Al Kharid continue to live their lives naturally, knowing that rsrc7266 has put rsrc1873 and the Elite Guard on it. When asked about it, Ali denies involvement and promises to have a talk with the Alis, explaining their behaviour by claiming they are simply enthusiastic from the move. Ali owns a shop of general stock that functions like an ordinary rsrc956, though players can only sell back the items he carries, unlike general stores. Players can buy rsrc2707 here. After the completion of the rsrc4894 miniquest, he expands his shop to sell: Note: Each time the player talks to Ali Morrisane, he will try to sell the player something. If you fail to resist, some unwanted junk may appear in your inventory and you will lose a few coins. However, some of these items may be sold back to Ali Morrisane to obtain a profit. Once rsrc4897 quest has been completed, Ali Morrisane will need the player's help once again. He wants to expand his business, and will require the perseverance of the player to deal with various suppliers all over RuneScape. One part of this miniquest includes a sudoku-style puzzle, which increases the types of runes that can be purchased. When the GE was instituted, the cost of runes were greatly increased and it is now rare to see players playing the puzzle or purchasing runes from Ali. "

These caves, which were formerly dungeons, have proven to provide good housing for the kingdom's people. Because the rsrc16301 have long been a subterranean people, rsrc1907 has selected them to expand the caves. However, because the dig must be done slowly, the dwarves work in shifts of two. Alviss is not currently digging, and so has the time off. During this time, he has been researching the past historical connections between the dwarves and rsrc3936, who have long inhabited what is now the Fremennik Province. Although his research is still in its early stages, Alviss has found a number of mythological connections between the two, suggesting that they had some type of contact prior to the dwarves' hiding during the rsrc1224.

After Amascut realises she no longer has control over the player, she possesses one of the rsrc773 in order to kill them. However, the player defeats the priest, and Amascut goes back to hiding.

He views Christmas as a false reality that mortals use to conceal and block out the fear and pain of everyday life, and believes that by letting mortals perceiving life as it is, they will be able to find the will-power to change the world. During the rsrc3103, he appeared when Jagex announces his appearance in the Wilderness via their Twitch channel and Twitter. He had a chance to drop rsrc1517 and rsrc9197. He could be found in rsrc2613 during rsrc1469's first anniversary. During the rsrc1510, he appears outside the rsrc9198 and requests aid from players in order to spread despair in the form of coal, which he states cannot be used for smelting, and exists solely to waste a player's bank space. Players who give him a full box each day will receive the following pieces of the rsrc1518 in order: rsrc1514, rsrc1513, rsrc1516, rsrc1509, and rsrc1515. Once players have obtained the full outfit, he would give players two noted rsrc1517 for each full box given to him. He is mentioned during the rsrc5690, where he summoned a rsrc15529 to sabotage Easter. After the demon's defeat, he decides to visit his friend, the rsrc1466, who takes him into his mansion to stay, pitying him. Despite their centuries-old friendship, Grim decides that after staying in his mansion for months, sitting on his sofa in his underwear and leaving his laundry on the floor, and constant ramblings about his conspiracy theories, that he needs to be evicted and asks the player for help to do so during the rsrc1465, as his Halloween party is approaching and influential figures are attending. He is lured outside the mansion after heating up the house and stewing some rsrc7238 in a cauldron. In rsrc6156's rsrc15919 with rsrc8717, Anti-Santa is visible from the corner of rsrc6154 outside the Party Room. "

He was a particularly good friend of rsrc2232, a former advisor of rsrc13944. They spent many hours talking to each other during the king's reign. One day, Hazelmere felt a great sadness, as if the Anima Mundi itself was crying out in pain. Hazelmere then suspected that Argento had died, but upon going to see him, found Argento seemingly alive and well, but refusing to talk to Hazelmere. Hazelmere, wondering what had happened to his old friend, went to a fellow advisor, rsrc13943, for advice. Oaknock theorised that an illusion had been cast on Argento, and immediately suspected the King's third advisor, rsrc12113, the only person known to be powerful enough to cast such a spell. Oaknock then constructed an anti-illusion machine, and brought King Healthorg and Glouphrie to Argento's body. Upon turning the machine on, Argento's death was revealed, with Oaknock saying that it must have been Glouphrie. King Healthorg became furious with Glouphrie, asking when it is ever right for someone to lie to their king. Glouphrie's reply that it's sometimes okay infuriates Healthorg even further and he dismisses Glouphrie on the spot, banishing him from the stronghold. Today, all that remains of Argento is a charred silver stump on the south side of the stronghold, near rsrc5006's rsrc4377. "

It can only be harmed if the player has at least six rsrc18 in their rsrc424 (in which case it will be level 125), however his rsrc173 will decrease to 75 if the player has at least 15 pieces of rsrc18. (Note: Do not bring gold ores into the instance, as they will be removed from your inventory) If players bring less than six ores, it will appear blue (with no combat level) and instantly regenerate all its hitpoints every time the player attacks it. The Arzinian Avatar will choose the rsrc10737 the player is weakest against; if the player uses melee, the avatar will use magic attacks once it manifests. When speaking to him in the centre of the mine, he will indicate which style he will use. For example, if the player is wearing magic equipment, it will state Your magic abilities are impressive, but my powers of archery will foil them! which indicates he will manifest as a ranger. This is simple to overcome by using the appropriate Protection rsrc81 or by bringing another set of rsrc4920 best suited to the avatar's attacks. Its name also changes along with his rsrc16727: Once its avatar is defeated, the being's spirit is banished back to Bordanzan, where it will take over a thousand years to attain enough power to manifest itself on Gielinor again. According to the rsrc2267 book, The Arzinian Being once terrorised the mines near Keldagrim. The Elders of Keldagrim decided to harness the power of rsrc18 to fight the Arzinian being and drive it out of the mines. After three days and three nights, the Arzinian Being was finally cornered inside a small tunnel, and with the power of the gold ore, the dwarves attempted to banish the demon back to Bordanzan. The combined power of so much gold overpowered the Arzinian Being, causing it to collapse into itself. It then \"tapped into its Bordanzian essence\", and caused all the nearby stone and debris to form a single rock around it, trapping itself in an impenetrable rock of gold.  Messages that you receive on-screen while mining gold ore in the mine suggest that the Avatar is enraged by you trying to take the gold from its lair, or that this is simply a front and it knows very well that gold is its weakness. The above may be a reference to Rock Wraiths who are either protectors of ore deposits, wayward golems or constructs that have lost their original purpose and seek another (like the Golem in the desert) or violent monsters that attack anything that approaches them. This seems to be a popular staple in dwarven lore in multiple fantasy/medieval games."

Here, somehow avoiding the aggressive rsrc6569 that had taken the temple, he claimed to be searching for someone that could help him craft a mysterious weapon known as a \"rsrc3415\". After crafting the bowsword, he instructed the adventurer to take a sphere to the holy isle of Saradomin, Entrana. Claiming to be one of their order, he said the sphere was a gift for a religious festival soon to be held on the island. Wanting the true nature of the sphere to remain a secret, and as simply taking a ferry rsrc405 would potentially risk revealing the sphere to the ships' crewmen, he requested the adventure to take it through the rsrc257, arriving on the island via the rsrc7493. Once on Entrana, the adventurer brought the sphere to the island's central rsrc11060, where the monks were preparing for the ceremony. Placing the sphere on an rsrc5869 without being noticed by the island's rsrc2956, the adventurer awaited the purpose of the sphere to be revealed. As the monks readied themselves, the monk teleported in, now wielding the bow-sword and dressed in the attire of an Assassin. Using the bow-sword, he attacked its congregation, slaying several members of the order. Stealing a \"relic\" from the altar, he rsrc5544 from the island. The sphere, discovered to be a teleportation beacon, had been designed solely to give the assassin immediate access to the island. After the adventurer rushed back to Paterdomus to confront the monk, they found what at first glance appeared to be his body. However, this was simply another monk the Assassin had murdered, to conceal his identity. The adventurer, realising what they had done, informed rsrc1778 of the rsrc12061 of the event. Sir Tiffy, claimed to already be aware of the situation, launched a Temple Knight investigation regarding the attack. "

While he has heard that Karamjan monkeys are inferior to them (since they have no societal structure), he is aware of their resourcefulness. He asks the player to rescue another of its kind from the rsrc937 before considering. When the player returns with the monkey, he allows them to stay as long as they want, while he considers the alliance. Later on, it is shown that he is secretly working with Glough, who sent him a rsrc46 to dispose of the 10th squad. In rsrc554, he plans another invasion alongside Glough's invasion. He is concerned with Kruk, as Kruk has been consistently late for the recent war meetings. The player finds Kruk in his rsrc2670, kills him, and uses rsrc2379's powers to masquerade as Kruk.

The player defeats the rsrc12248rsrc13032, destroys the war fleet, and foils the \"secret\" weapon. When Awowogei hears of this, he dismisses Kruk for his failures and eventually decides on placing rsrc8058 as the head of the ninja monkey guards. At the end of the quest, he negotiates peace with rsrc6482, stating that Glough would have sent the \"two races into their deaths\". It is presumed that Awowogei found out what the \"secret\" weapon was, and was horrified by what Glough had planned to do with his people. He opens the gates of Ape Atoll to all visitors as a result of this new peace treaty. Awowogei is part of the rsrc10647. During the banquet, he is frozen by the rsrc3781, but Gypsy Aris saves everyone in time. The player speaks with Awowogei in Ape Atoll in an attempt to find out what his favorite food is, but he refuses to reveal it. The player eventually finds out through the three monkeys he mentions that his favorite food is the rsrc8853. When given to free him from the Cuilnaromancer's grasp, Awowogei remarks about the tasteful flavors of the snake, and teaches the player the rsrc2070 spell. King Awowogei is the solution to the hard rsrc4568: WOO AN EGG KIWI, with a challenge scroll answer of 24. Those seeking King Awowogei for the anagram clue directed by Hard Clue Scrolls should remember to bring a Karamjan Monkey Greegree and a Monkeyspeak amulet to access his building. "

Players can speak to a banker either by clicking the banker or by clicking on the bank booth. However, it is not necessary to speak to a banker to use the bank. Players can right-click the banker and select \"Bank Banker\" to access the bank interface directly, or left-click the counter to access their bank. If the player only wants to deposit, he or she should look for the rsrc9478 (it is cylindrical). This can only be used to deposit items but this isn't very popular with players. Though in some areas, such as rsrc405, it is the only option for banking. The bankers in the rsrc340 robbery recording have 15-25 rsrc16757. The rsrc806 bank on the second floor is run by the rsrc16758. Normal bankers can be interacted with from two squares away, instead of the usual one for rsrc15930. Presumably, this is to allow players to access them when there is a bank booth occupying the square directly in between the player and the banker. This principle can be seen in with the bankers in rsrc3139, who can be interacted with from two squares away despite the lack of any bank booth."

Barakur's absence from the game itself leaves his fate unknown.

When players enquire what the bartender means by this, he makes a brief attempt at explaining what a computer is, calling it a \"magic box\". However, considering that RuneScape is set in another world in a rsrc16765 or rsrc16766-like era, the player is baffled, and calls the bartender crazy (although players seems to acknowledge that RuneScape is a computer game while talking to rsrc11741, the priest in the rsrc806 rsrc11060). The bartender also serves a purpose in level 1 rsrc82. In some rsrc403, he may be the person to give you your next clue, or he may give you your reward. During the rsrc2214 rsrc16002, he is one of the Bartenders that you must get a drink from. His drink is the \"Uncle Humphry's Gutrot\".

After the quest, Bill will transport players from Port Phasmatys to Mos Le'Harmless and vice-versa.

For players who do not want the book and only want to travel on Bill Teach's ship, use the right-click 'Travel' option, as talking to Bill Teach starts a moderate conversation ending with him giving the book again, before he will ask if the player wishes to sail with him.

    "article-text": "During Dragon Slayer II: Formerly Robert the Strong, now a cat. Bob the Jagex cat is an enigmatic black rsrc1625 and reincarnation of the ancient hero rsrc5484. He travels the world of rsrc3096 with his girlfriend, rsrc13002, although he generally returns to his human rsrc4423's house every week. Like all cats, his speech can only be understood through the use of the rsrc4224. As Bob likes to wander the world, he has one of the largest wander radii of all rsrc15930 in the game, spawning in his human Unferth's house in rsrc803 every time there is a system update, but after which he is able to wander anywhere that is not restricted by physical boundaries, being able to wander to far away places such as rsrc259 and rsrc405. It is possible to locate Bob by using the catspeak amulet after it is enchanted in rsrc1498 which, when operated, will open a menu that looks like a cat's face. By clicking on the whiskers, the dial will rotate. When the eyes light up and a cat meowing sound is heard, Bob can be found in the direction that the dial is pointing. The incarnation of the hero rsrc5484, Robert's memories as a human were locked away. Bob's earliest memories was that of a kitten, and that he was raised by rsrc4221. Eventually, he came into the care of rsrc4423, though Bob often wandered around the world for days, worrying his owner needlessly. During rsrc1498, Unferth asks an adventurer to help him find Bob, as he had not come back for longer than expected, worrying him greatly. The adventurer, with their cat and rsrc3937, were able to locate Bob. When found, Bob tells the adventurer that he is trying to get the attention of another cat named rsrc13002, who is uninterested in him because she does not know about his past. Bob is later convinced that he is Robert the Strong, but he is unsure because he has no memories. The adventurer and their cat head to rsrc450 to get the rsrc4225's help, who reveals that Bob is actually Robert the Strong. Neite, who the Sphinx also teleported to Sophanem, falls in love with Bob and the two go on a journey across RuneScape. Bob gives the adventurer some chores for Unferth to do. Later on in rsrc230, the adventurer finds Bob and attempts to convince him that he is Robert the Strong. Bob doesn't remember anything, and the Sphinx is unable to help. However, the adventurer soon remembers the rsrc5574, who gives them the rsrc5570. The adventurer makes the potion again, and they enter Bob's rsrc5571. After beating a dream guardian of his human form, Bob then remembers everything as Robert the Strong and helps the player in finding the rsrc922 that were hidden all over the world. Bob told the adventurer that he had personally hidden two of the key pieces; one in an rsrc1259 north of rsrc678, and another on the rsrc2948. He also entrusted two of the key pieces to his fellow heroes rsrc920 and rsrc5488. Camorra went to the far west, while Bob assumed that Tristan's family was still in rsrc378. He warned them that he did not feel comfortable with opening the Vault, and that they should do so at their own risk. After the player reforges the key, they enter the Vault and find a rsrc6010 incubating in a large pool. rsrc1237, a Dragonkin approached the trio, and Bob immediately recognised him. Zorgoth also recognised Bob as a result, and remarked on how he turned into a cat. The two argued over who was right and wrong, before Zorgoth called for Galvek. Bob narrowly avoided being incinerated by Galvek, as the adventurer grabbed him and ran. He later attended a meeting with the human leaders, and told the adventurer that the war wouldn't be over until Zorgoth was killed. He noted that if Galvek was killed, Zorgoth would be too. While incapable of fighting, Bob insisted on coming along with the assault force. When the adventurer eventually arrived at the fleet's grand ship, Bob informed them of the situation. After disposing of the dragons on the ship, Zorgoth and Galvek arrived. Galvek killed four Varrockian guards, before focusing its attention on the adventurer. The adventurer jumped out of the way to avoid its dragonfire, and Bob, who was right behind the adventurer, was incinerated as a result. This enraged them, and they eventually killed Galvek and Zorgoth. What was left of Bob was later buried across Unferth's house. Both Unferth and Neite were distraught over his death. Bob is often seen, mostly by chance, by many players. The rsrc4224, which is received in rsrc778, is required to speak to Bob; otherwise, he will simply meow aloud. Note that after the events of rsrc230, Bob can no longer be found wandering RuneScape. When a character first speaks to Bob with their Catspeak amulet, the following dialogue ensues: Bob then says a rsrc13003. If a player has a cat follower when he or she speaks to Bob, the conversation goes quite differently. On subsequent encounters, only a shorter, more random conversation occurs. Bob may instead tell the player a rule for cats to follow. These poke fun at the idiosyncratics common to housepet cats.  The dialogue between Bob and the player's cat follower is clearly a reference to the movie Star Wars: Episode V the Empire Strikes Back, where a similar dialog occur near the end of the movie. Bob is often a nickname given to those bearing the name Robert, which fits due to Bob's past as Robert the Strong"

The rsrc16812 competence in handling the plague and his fear of it, however, deters him from taking any action. In order to curb the stress stemming from his responsibilities in the plague-stricken West Ardougne, he has taken to heavy drinking. As a result, he is criticized by the population as not being a able administrator due to his drunkenness and laissez faire leadership style of delegating most of the day-to-day city administration to the Mourners. Bravek, like the rest of the Ardougne population, is oblivious to the plague as a hoax.

He provides players with a rsrc1826 which will allow them to visit rsrc207 as a peaceful ambassador.

After completing Lunar Diplomacy, players are able to visit the island without the seal of passage, but will still be unable to talk to anyone. This changes after the player completes rsrc1829, at which point rsrc16827 becomes a rsrc2155 on Lunar Isle, who will allow players to access their bank even without a seal of passage. Brundt will replace seals of passage for free if a player loses or destroys it. Because of this, it is advisable for players who have not completed Dream Mentor to destroy their seal of passages when they are done with them. This is because if a player has a seal of passage in their bank, but forgets to bring it with them to Lunar Isle, there is no nearby bank to get it from, and since the seal of passage is in their bank, Brundt will not give them another one. Contrarily, if a player has destroyed their seal of passage, Brundt will give them one without necessitating a trip to a bank. Brundt the Chieftain is the solution to the medium rsrc4568: Dt Run B.

Buggie proceeded to search for the rsrc16441 insects in the desert, hoping to convince the zoo to give him his own exhibit. He stole kalphite eggs from the rsrc5287 and prepared a rsrc5288 with sand to cover the rocky cavern floor.

Players must pay him the wage every eight uses of his services. The butler has inventory space for 20 items and a trip time of 12 seconds. Players can hire the butler at the rsrc8567, which is located north of the marketplace in East rsrc23. All five servants wander inside the building except for the servant you have hired (if any). Before hiring any servant, the player must meet three requirements: The services provided by servants can be cosmetic or vital resources for training Construction efficiently. Actions marked with an (*) count as one service before payment is required. The butler can: Many players prefer the Butler over the Demon Butler for several reasons. First, the Butler is only slightly slower, yet is half the cost of the Demon butler. Because of this, the Butler's cost per item is only 32 coins whereas the Demon butler's cost per item is 48 coins. Second, using the Butler often provides faster experience than the Demon butler. A player building rsrc11405 will find that they can build two doors in the time that it takes the Butler to get planks from the bank, and finish just as the Butler returns. This allows for constant experience to be gained. The Demon Butler is faster, and while it is possible to build two oak doors before he returns, some players may have difficulty doing so resulting in interruptions during training.  The Butler never says the player's name. He always calls the player Sir or Madam, as he was taught in the Servants' Guild. Despite his claims to never address the player in the second person, when requesting his pay, he refers to the player as \"you\" twice. This may be due to him not being under the player's service during this period, or an oversight. The Butler only smiles when the player gives him his pay. He claims to be the best mortal servant that any player can have because the Demon butler isn't a mortal. If you tell him to bring back more than 20 items he will only bring back 20, but if you click the first option when you ask him to bring more, he will bring back the number you previously asked him to bring (only the first time after). When asked to un-note or carry bones he says, \"I have too much respect for the dead to transport these bones.\" Building materials includes clay, which makes it quick and easy to make rsrc16834.

Since players need a rsrc3390 to enter the caves, they may be greatly tempted to pay the price if they do not have a light source with them. However, using an open flame (such as a candle) as a light source in the caves is extremely dangerous, since the caves are full of highly flammable swamp gas. The resulting explosion can do serious damage to players' rsrc65, even quite high-level players. Nevertheless, the candle seller's strategy is to provide items for sale where players perceive they need them, and to sell them at high prices. This makes him one of the most brilliant salesmen in RuneScape, along with rsrc3335. His only weakness is that he is prone to explaining how to make rsrc3390, which could easily put him out of business. The candle seller, obviously, never leaves his position near the entrance to the Lumbridge Swamp Caves. The option \"No thanks, I'd rather curse the darkness\" is probably a reference to the phrase \"Better light a candle than curse the darkness\"."

It is derived from RNG, which means \"random number generator.\" Despite referring to Arengeesus as the \"God of Luck\", deities who are female are usually referred to as a goddess."

The golem is one of the last survivors of its race (though there are a few other golems found in the rsrc1184), as they were wiped out in the rsrc1224 by rsrc6579, a commander of rsrc1220, and his armies. This clay golem was part of an army of clay golems that were created to fight Thammaron, who later died of his injuries in the rsrc15845 after being mortally wounded, though all the other golems, Uzer itself, and the rsrc2859 inhabitants of the city, were killed in the battle. Remarkably, the Golem survived the battle and remained in the city of Uzer for thousands of years, until the settlement became visited again in the rsrc2390. A famous rsrc16059 discovered the golem, which was badly damaged from years of being exposed to the sun and sandstorms of the rsrc1094. After repairing the golem, which still believed it had to kill Thammaron, and writing a rsrc2796 and placing it in the back of the golem's head, the adventurer made the golem understand that its mission had been completed. Despite the city being destroyed, the golem holds little regret in the city's destruction stating how golems don't really care much about aesthetics. It soon saw action again when the adventurer lures out rsrc16530 from his dimension as it was used along with several Saradomists to summon back the demon to slay it for good.  It seems to follow rsrc16884, meaning that it cannot harm a human or allow a human to come to harm. This is because in Jewish mythology, rsrc16885 were constructs that were animated solely by magic for a specific purpose. This makes golems much like modern robots, albeit made of weaker materials (though metals were still used for golems), which seems to accurately describe the clay golem."

Commander Veldaban can be found in the headquarters, west of the Keldagrim bank. As Veldaban is a commander of an elite dwarven force, he may appear harsh at first, but is actually a warm-hearted individual with the city's best interests at heart. He is always aware of all that takes place within the city and will always justify his actions while not causing unnecessary victims. He is kind and cares for all inhabitants of the city, especially the poor dwarves in the East. Veldaban is particularly suspicious of rsrc9684 and their brutal methods of business. Much of Veldaban's early history remains unknown. His father is rsrc9252, a rich and old miner. In 169, the Red Axe bribed the rsrc6549 who ferries visitors from and to the entrance of Keldagrim to crash his boat into the statue of the great rsrc5617, which was in the middle of the rsrc10748, as soon as a human would board the boat. That way, Hreidmar could convince the other mining companies to rebuild the statue bearing his visage, rather than Alvis'. Soon, an adventurer asked the boatman to be ferried to Keldagrim on their first visit there, and indeed the boat smashed into the giant statue, looking like an accident. On shore, the adventurer was arrested by the Black Guard. They were taken to Veldaban, but the commander knew it was just an accident (everyone unaware of the Red Axe's plot) and he cleared the adventurer. However, he suggest that they help rsrc13954 in rebuilding the statue and so they did. They then joined a Consortium mining company and worked their way up to be able to access the next meeting. While Blasidar had been able to reconstruct the body based on the king's old, preserved items, he was unable to build the head of the king. As such, the mining companies congregated to discuss which director's head to put onto the statue, figuring that the Age of Kings had passed. Veldaban and the adventurer attended the meeting and, because the directors couldn't come to an agreement, the adventurer was given the last say. They voted for the director of the company they joined to be the model and everyone agreed except for Hreidmar. The Red Axe director, realising his plan had failed, threatened the consortium but was not taken seriously. He left in a rage with his rsrc13175, even going so far as have the Red Axe step out of the Consortium completely. At some point, an employee of a minor company, the Magenta Accordion, went on an investigation in the abandoned mines south of Keldagrim. After some travelling, they discovered a Red Axe hideout and an army of chaos dwarves. His memory was quickly wiped by Grunsh and he became nothing more than an rsrc13530. The dwarf caused some havoc in East Keldagrim, so Veldaban sent his new friend, the adventurer, to investigate. In return for a rsrc5640, the drunken dwarf revealed being able to remember going into the abandoned mines. After entering the mine, they encountered Hreidmar discussing plans with Grimsson and Grunsh, finding out they were responsible for the breaking of the statue. They then found archives of the Red Axe, containing records of the dwarven boatman and the drunken dwarf, amongst many others. Farther into the cave, they found Hreidmar and Grimsson showing their newest batch of chaos dwarves to Laneel, a rsrc10744 from Arposandra, before being spotted by Grunsh, who erased their memory. They found themselves back in Keladgrim, unable to recount what had happened. They attempted to report to Veldaban, but could only think of rsrc140 and rsrc787. They proceeded to drink themselves unconscious in the rsrc950, with Grimsson spying from outside and concluding that the human was no longer a problem. "

The cook is working on a rsrc748, probably cleaning it. Players can insult him by describing his kitchen as \"horrible\", although he will take extreme offence to this and say that his \"daily sweat and elbow-grease keep this kitchen clean\" (which players misinterpret and exclaim, \"Eww!\"). This cook seems to be far less happy in his work than other cooks around Gielinor.

Another bridge in Mort'ton leads to rsrc781, the hometown of Cyreg's organisation, the Myreque. Cyreg's boatride is used heavily during the quest rsrc8624 and is popular as a shortcut to the southern parts of Morytania, which will deduct much journey time and attacks from rsrc2320, rsrc11056 and vampyres.  After the rsrc8624 rsrc132, if a player speaks to Cyreg he will say that he feels guilty for telling the player how to get to the rsrc4273 because the player had unknowingly led rsrc4199 straight to their hideout, which caused rsrc13422 and rsrc14396 to be killed by Vanstrom."

Cyrisus is located deep in the rsrc6553, where he has been unconscious for some time. In rsrc1829, the rsrc16059 nurses him back to good health, but only known to the player at that point as \"Fallen Man\", by providing him with food and words of encouragement, until he is well enough to reveal to the player who he is. He requests that the player fetch him his favourite outfit from his bank, depending on what the player's rsrc173 is based on. Once he is dressed he reveals that although he is incredibly skilled, being able to smith full sets of rsrc16144, bake rsrc4581 and grow rsrc16913, and with a combat level of 126, he has 99 in most if not all combat skills, but he is mortally afraid of combat. (He says he got his skills by killing 300 chickens a day for 30 years). The rsrc5574 suggests that the player helps Cyrisus overcome this fear by entering rsrc5571 with him to help him conquer his fears. Once the player enters Cyrisus's dreamland and vanquishes rsrc5575, rsrc5573, rsrc5569, rsrc5572 and rsrc11385 Cyrisus has, he overcomes his fear of combat. By way of thanks, he shares with the player rsrc19 he picked up during his time on Lunar Isle. After Cyrisus leaves, his newfound lust for battle takes over. If the player rsrc854 he will either be killing the rsrc2464 with some slayer masters, fighting rsrc3483, attending a meeting with the leaders of rsrc15920. Since most of the time he's travelling around rsrc3096 looking for new adventures, it is impossible to find him at a specific location. In order to contact him you must use the rsrc854 lunar spell.

You do know they rot your teeth?\" And if you use rsrc2439 on him, a message will appear: \"How evil!

Players also need to have two bedrooms with beds in their rsrc156. Once he has been hired, players can find him in their house. Alathazdrar began his trade as a servant to rsrc15909 nobility; his previous clients include rsrc6579 and rsrc9484. However, he claims to have grown tired of \"the incessant shadows and hellfire\" and as a result departed from the underworld to seek out rsrc2859 employers. Alathazdrar ended up as a member of the Servants' Guild in Ardougne, and is the most accomplished servant for hire there. Alathazdrar can serve rsrc3425 to players and their guests, take items to and from the rsrc1074, take logs to the rsrc7667 in exchange for rsrc2159 faster than any other servant, and welcome guests (will not un-note bones). He can carry up to 26 items and has a bank time of 7.2 seconds. Also note that every 8 actions, such as trips to the bank, he will require a payment fee of 10,000 coins. This fee can be paid automatically by having a rsrc11400. If using the rsrc8510 method to level Construction, it is best to have the Demon Butler fetch oak planks when you have 8 planks in your inventory, as he can hold 26 items, you can take another Larder worth from him, and whilst you're making the next larder he will be back by the time its made for you to continuously make them. He has a similar appearance and chathead to rsrc13924, the rsrc4116. Alathazdrar is one of the very few demons in RuneScape who is friendly to players. Alathazdrar has unique blue text when in dialogue with players. This may suggest that he has an unusual or unnatural voice."

After completing Swan Song, Devin can be found near the Colony's western wall, where he is working on improving the players' repair job.

While he had many dwarves helping him at one point, they have all since left, leaving him alone in his work. He now spends every bit of money he can dredge up in an attempt to open the rock. Dondakan has tried many different methods to break the rock, such hitting it with a pickaxe, shooting it with several types of cannonballs, and kicking it with granite boots. None have been successful, and the cost has taken a toll on him. Once the quest is complete, he can send players to the rsrc16204, the largest gold mine in rsrc1469, although they must be wearing a rsrc4133.  Dondakan has 6 un-obtainable items - all cannonballs from bronze to rune except rsrc4132. It is unknown why he would try bronze or iron cannonballs, as they would obviously not have as much of an impact as standard steel cannonballs. It is possible that he predicted that a massive number of shots would be needed to crack the rock and was attempting to save money. It is also possible that Vincent Van M (the developer who created this NPC and the Between a Rock quest) intended to emphasize how hard the rock was to break while making a humorous observation based on the player's inability to smith cannonballs from every tier of rsrc4712 available in the game. Players may attempt to buy his rsrc6625, but he will not sell them for any price offered. If players have granite boots in their possession, they will be able to engage in unique dialogue when speaking to him."

The areas/events where the Doomsayer has placed warning signs are as follows: These warning signs may be toggled on/off after the player has seen them roughly 6-8 times. A good way to be able to toggle them faster is to click the entrance to where one was going, and click \"No\" 6-8 times. After that period, they may switch them on or off as they like. Doomsayer is the solution to the hard rsrc4568: DO SAY MORE. The answer to the rsrc4274 is 95.

    "article-text": "Dr. Fenkenstrain is a rsrc6277 involved in the rsrc1751 and rsrc2254 rsrc132. Players may pick his pocket to obtain a rsrc2521. At first Dr. Fenkenstrain was a lonely scientist who lived in parts unknown. Later on he decided to move into rsrc2264, but due to it being inhabited by rsrc16660 he knew he would surely be killed. However, in order to avoid this, he obtained employment with a local rich human family who possessed the rsrc2521, an ancient magic talisman that fools werewolves into thinking the human who possesses it to be another werewolf. Fenkenstrain eventually decided to steal the ring of charos but was caught by his master, rsrc5215, and Fenkenstrain was forced to kill him. With his master dead, Fenkenstrain was later caught by the other family members, and he killed them as well. With the family dead, Fenkenstrain took control of the rsrc1752 and got rid of the bodies by selling them as meat for the rsrc8083 inn in rsrc284. Eventually the family gardener started suspecting the disappearance of the family and a desperate Fenkenstrain sent him to dig graves in the woods. However, when the gardener left, Fenkenstrain followed him and decapitated him with a spade, turning him into the headless rsrc5214. Since then Fenkenstrain has lived alone in the castle, however he eventually started recruiting a new assistant, leading to the events of the rsrc1751 quest. Dr. Fenkenstrain appears in the quests rsrc1751 and rsrc2254. Fenkenstrain meets the hero in this quest, here the hero gets Fenkenstrain a pair of arms, a pair of legs, a torso, a head and a brain. Upon doing this Fenkenstrain unites these pieces into a human body and, using lightning, he brings the creature back to life. However the brain that was used is the one of Lord Rologarth, whom Fenkenstrain had killed years ago. Upon learning the history of the castle, the hero turns on Fenkenstrain by stealing the ring of charos from him. Fenkenstrain - now human to the werewolves again - locks himself in the highest tower of the castle to be safe. In the Great Brain Robbery, the hero needs a brain surgeon to transplant brains into undead monks of rsrc4578, and decides to go with Fenkenstrain. Fenkenstrain at first refuses but then considers the fact that the werewolves will not get him in Harmony Island and decides to go. After the surgery, rsrc10990, the undead surgeon that had removed the brains in the first place gets infuriated and sets his robotic, undead, bodyguard monster rsrc2256 on the Doctor and the hero saves Fenkenstrain by killing the beast. Upon seeing his monster defeated, Mi-Gor flees to parts unknown. Fenkenstrain decides to stay on Harmony Island (in the basement under the windmill) to make up for his past mistakes.  The name \"Fenkenstrain\" is partly based upon the character of rsrc16957 of the 1818 gothic novel of the same name. In fact, Fenkenstrain is an rsrc16958 of Frankenstein. The examine text is a reference to a famous quote said by rsrc16959 when he met rsrc16960, an explorer in Africa in the 19th century. Dr. Fenkenstrain is allergic to rsrc5544, as mentioned in rsrc2254"

The Drunken Dwarf recently claims to have witnessed an army of kebabs in a mine outside the city. He plays a large role in rsrc138 He is also either the brother, cousin or family-member of the rsrc15919 rsrc3570. However, he does not give out free kebabs or rsrc787 to players who ask him for it. While his counterpart travels around the world, he's taking care of his home until he comes back. He asks the player for a rsrc5640 in order for him to tell his story of the kebabs, which actually is a recap of what he found in the rsrc16549's HQ hidden beneath Keldagrim, but nobody believes it because they just think it's a forgettable tale of a drunken dwarf, which is the title of the quest. After drinking the Kelda stout, he recounts his history, telling about many things that at first glance don't make much sense, one of them being pink dragons, which the player decides to ignore. It is revealed during the quest that his stories were true, but the army of kebabs was in fact an army of rsrc16969 developed by the Red Axe Mining Company, which had recently left the rsrc7346 and Keldagrim after the events of rsrc3376. But, he couldn't remember that because his memories had been erased by rsrc10742, an rsrc2480 who used his memory-altering spell, which left him with a dangerous kebab-and-beer obsession as a side-effect. A strange fact is that, while he seems to be drunk, he claims to be sober, but when you give him the Kelda stout, he says that he gets even more drunk, but his way of speaking shows that he's in fact sobered up, as he stops shambling and speaks perfectly like a normal person. After the quest, he appears even more drunk than before, possibly because he drank the Kelda stout. He also tells about an army of mindless, kebab-eating dwarves and says: \"THE KEBABSH WILL COME FOR YOU!\". The Drunken Dwarf is the answer to the clue scroll anagram \"DR WARDEN FUNK\", he will give you a puzzle box to solve. "

In the rsrc4401, while preparing to produce this year's chocolate eggs, the Easter Bunny was visited by a travelling merchant who persuaded him to buy a potion that would make the chocolate taste better. However immediately after he added it to the mixture it began to bubble and an evil rsrc4403 hatched out of it, destroying the eggs and the presents within them. The player is requested to slay the foul chicken. In the rsrc2403, he is trying to add some variety of flavours into chocolate eggs, as people's interest in them are dwindling. He will ask the player to help his son, rsrc2619, to experiment on new flavours. The player helps Chocco, but is knocked out by him after giving him several flavoured eggs to taste. The player then discovers that Chocco stole the credit for the new egg flavours, while the Easter Bunny refuses to believe the player. As a result, the player threatens to give his recipes to the Easter Bunny's competitors, resulting in the Easter Bunny submitting to the player. In the rsrc4303, the Easter Bunny asks for the player's help, well aware they are to do all the work in resolving their problems. Upon completion of the event, he questions why he is employed when all their problems are always solved by passing adventurers. When the player asks who his employer is, he states that it is far above their pay grade to know about that. "

Dag'eth was one of a group of elders that lead the Dagon'hai for many years prior to the burning of the Wizards' Tower. Despite the role of the Zamorakians in the rsrc1224, they had been tolerated in society for some time. This had allowed the Dagon'hai to establish themselves in rsrc378 with little conflict. Despite the apparently calm situation, beneath the surface a silent war was being waged between the Church of rsrc1222 and the Dagon'hai. Dag'eth was one of the war's orchestrators, ensuring that his people were constantly on the move. At some point he promoted rsrc9497 to the rank of Hyeraph, a decision that would eventually lead to his promotion to leader. When the Wizards' Tower was burned, the Dagon'hai were discovered and forced to leave Varrock. Most were killed in the subsequent battle, but a small number managed to escape. Dag'eth remained behind, along with a number of other defenders such as rsrc9495 and rsrc9498, the group's two other leaders. Dag'eth is believed to have been killed while he let his comrades escaped, although he may have survived and later been executed. Sin'keth would later go on to lead in his absence."

Following this, Enakhra dwelt in her temple for thousands of years and did not come out, though the last that the rsrc2859 in the surrounding area learned was that she was \"thinking of ending her rivalry with Akthanakos\".

Payment is made by selecting the desired rune type using a special window that appears.

To reduce banking costs, it is recommended to pay with low value runes, such as rsrc830 and rsrc3183. This banker is normally used to retrieve rsrc841 to craft at the rsrc1629. Players can speak to him to set up a quick-deal payment, allowing Eniola to automatically take 20 of a chosen rune without having to pay through the pre-banking interface.

The snowman wore a rsrc6276, and its examine text was \"Really wants to be built.\" When the duck was released it was widely seen as a case of Jagex displaying favouritism to certain players. This is because the duck was named after a Runescape streamer on the popular gameplay streaming website Twitch.tv. rsrc15852 came under the most heavy criticism as he implemented the update. Many players were also concerned that, unlike most content updates in rsrc1469, this addition was not added to a rsrc11096 to be voted on by the community before being added to the game. Mod Reach posted a thread on Reddit's Old School RuneScape subreddit regarding the issue, and formally apologised for the incidentrsrc274: I want to take a few moments to apologise to you and explain where, why, how and what next will happen with regards to the new duck NPC in Falador Park. First off, we think it's important to explain the motives and reasoning behind the decision to add a new NPC to the game outside of poll. The original duck model was built inside the Easter event earlier this year, and as a nice gesture, I decided to move it to Falador park and rename it after a popular streamer as a thank you for their feedback and continued effort to support the game. Initially, this wasn\u2019t part of our development plan or schedule and was implemented quickly to have it in-game in time for the removal of Easter. In retrospect, it\u2019s clear that the decision wasn\u2019t in line with our ethos and caused a considerable upset and division within the community, something we definitely did not intend to happen. Furthermore, the handling of the situation in regards to the removal of topics discussing the duck, whether they be positive or negative, was definitely poor. As a result, the NPC has been removed from the game in the update which went live earlier. Lastly, but by no means least, I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to apologise for this incident. It\u2019s not within our nature to cause divisions or negative sentiment within our communities and part of what makes us a strong and focussed team is the support, feedback and continued existence of all player driven and controlled communities - Something we have always taken time to engage ourselves with and support. To sum up, what do you think we should do next to ensure the quality and implementation of updates are in line with your expectations and how we can avoid situations like this in future. Mod Reach and the Old School Team.\""

Estate agents can also redecorate the outside of a player's house for a fee. Along with a total redecoration of a house, each house style comes with a unique tune that plays upon entering the house. These House Styles are irrespective of the location your house is in. For example you could have a Great Kourend house style while your POH is situated in Yanille. Here is a list of all the house styles available: Estate agents can move a POH from its starting location in rsrc998 to any of the other rsrc289 locations identified by the portal icon (rsrc17001) on the rsrc8743.

Although they resemble small rsrc2859, they are not too dissimilar from bugs, with their quick beating wings, antennae and wide eyes. The Fairies often travel to the world of rsrc3096, being in charge of maintaining the world's weather, the growth of crops, and the passing of seasons. They operate from Gielinor's moon, rsrc3820, and are co-ordinated jobs by the rsrc12342. According to rsrc6317, the majority of Fairies are rsrc2168, but there are exceptions. The Fairies have lived in Zanaris for a long time, since before rsrc2168 arrived, although they are not native to it. It has been described as 'the nexus of all planes' by the rsrc12342 and rsrc8786. When the fairies arrived, they found Zanaris to be a place with many dormant magical properties, such as those of the ability to jump between planes using a powerful portal that had been sealed for centuries. The rsrc4615 harnessed the magic of this portal, and used it to create the network of rsrc4594. The god of balance, Guthix, later travelled to Zanaris while searching for a world in the First Age, and upon finding Gielinor, he used Zanaris to bring peaceful races to Gielinor. Fairies appear to live in the air and fly around frequently. They rely heavily on magic and delight in mischief. Fairies are mysterious to outsiders, who know little of their culture and history. Indeed, many of the other mortal races would happily deny the existence of this tiny race, as most believe fairies are imaginary creatures. The Fairies also seem to be a female-dominated race. The fairies are involved with the following rsrc132; During the Quest \"A Fairy Tale Part II\" players will encounter a fairy who has lost one of her arms, of which the examine info is \"It's just a flesh wound.\" This refers to the black knight's famous quote in rsrc16225's Holy Grail."

Flax Keeper is the solution to the medium rsrc4568: PEAK REFLEX. He will present a challenge scroll containing the question: If I have 1014 flax, and I spin a third of them into bowstring, how many flax do I have left? The answer is 676.

He was a rsrc1694 incubated by the rsrc1234 rsrc1237, who planned to use Galvek to destroy humanity after being imprisoned for ages because he was presumed to be a violent Dragonkin. Zorgoth gave it the name \"Galvek\" because it was the Dragonkin word for \"Fate\". Galvek is a special breed of dragon, as it is more serpent-like and has the ability to control other dragons. Galvek was later killed by the player in a prolonged battle. He attempted to launch a final ball of rsrc1395 at the player, but collapsed before he was able to do so, incinerating his creator instead. The main fight takes place in an rsrc11750; if the player dies battling Galvek, they can pay 100,000 coins to rsrc5491 to reclaim their items. If players die elsewhere, these items will be lost. In addition to this, Torfinn's holding capabilities do not stack with others (e.g rsrc688, rsrc426), so if players have items being held by one of these fights and dies to Galvek, the items there will be lost. After the quest, players can fight Galvek again through the rsrc13946 in the rsrc3068. Deaths here are considered safe. Galvek has 1,200 health and four phases, with each phase consisting of 300 rsrc65 each. He uses all three forms of rsrc712, and a special rsrc1395 attack which is capable of killing players in one hit if they do not move away from it, regardless of their protection. If next to the tile, which was hit by dragonfire, players take half the damage instead. The effects of rsrc4984 do not work against Galvek. He can also launch pink dragonfire, which disables all prayers upon impact. Galvek stands at the bow of the ship, attacking players with rsrc507 and rsrc59. He can occasionally launch fire bombs, which if touched (bombs cover a 3x3 radius), will deal an incredible amount of damage, and will very likely instantly kill the player. These fire bombs are always placed in the same position, and will explode after a set amount of time has passed. This phase is common to die in due to players trying to move to avoid his rsrc1395 attack or moving at the same time Galvek teleports them, resulting in the player running into a bomb and dying. Galvek takes on the powers of air, flying towards the western side of the ship. He can occasionally launch gusts of wind that drain the player's stats by 2 and run energy by 40%. Galvek also begins to use rsrc78 attacks here and uses his Ranged and rsrc59 attacks at random. Galvek takes on the powers of water, flying towards the eastern side of the ship. He can occasionally send out tsunami waves (acting much like the rsrc17057 firewalls in RuneScape 3) along with the standard one-hit fireball. If hit by these waves, the player will take damage equal to their health. Phase III has the potential to be Galvek's deadliest phase, as the player is incredibly limited to movement if Galvek launches his tsunami and his fireball subsequently, leaving almost no room for error. Galvek also uses rsrc78 attacks much more commonly in this phase. Galvek takes on the powers of earth, landing on the middle of the ship. He can occasionally launch earth projectiles, which if the player is caught in, will be bound for several seconds. This deals no actual damage to the player, but leaves them extremely vulnerable to the highly damaging rsrc1395, which he almost always uses if he is successful in binding the player. His earth attack can be avoided by simply moving one square. Moreover, walking in circles around Galvek allows the player to avoid his rocks and dragonfire. "

His followers believe that he is an undead maniac who died over 200 years ago, but he is an actuality a rsrc1220 rsrc9686. He has established a large territory between rsrc23 and rsrc1632 and is at war with the rsrc172. He may be fought after killing rsrc9341, his pet rsrc1326 and only friend, though it is not required. He is spoken to frequently during rsrc4638 rsrc1372. General Khazard is the owner of the rsrc7395 and the one who ordered his men to invade the rsrc222. During the rsrc7382 rsrc132, he kidnaps members of rich families, such as rsrc14141's rsrc7397 and rsrc14142, and forces them to fight for their lives at his arena for the entertainment of citizens of Khazard. However, during the quest, he makes a bet with the player, and if the player beats all his monsters, he sets all his fight slaves free. The hero defeats all of Khazard's monsters, and an angry Khazard sets his pet rsrc1326, rsrc9341, on him. The player kills Bouncer, and an enraged Khazard attempts to kill the player, only to be defeated in combat. He survives and later appears in rsrc4638 rsrc1372. After the quest, he can be found on the second floor of the Fight Arena building, and may be fought if he was not defeated during the quest. Khazard is also featured during rsrc4638 rsrc1372. In it, the player meets Khazard's ghost in the Fremennik Forest. The General appears to have forgotten the player's role in his defeat, as he charges him/her with speaking to several messengers scattered across rsrc3096. After this is done, Khazard tells the player to visit the rsrc10727 near the rsrc749 for his/her reward. The \"reward\", however, is a lie, as the General does indeed remember the player's name, and sets a trap for him/her. Upon entering the cave, the player is ambushed by the spectre of the General's pet, rsrc9348. This is not his true form, and he probably thinks other rsrc9686 are weak themselves, as he refers to \"them\" as cunning, not strong. He has some influence in the ghost world, as he was able to send some of his scouts to spy on human strongholds.  General Khazard seems to wield an rsrc7129 with one hand, yet attacks with two. Similar to rsrc3738's case, who wields a rsrc4640 and a rsrc2629 with both hands. General Khazard seems to wield an iron 2h sword, but he has the same rsrc73 as a rsrc633, which has an attack speed of 6. General Khazard's face appeared as a skull, just like many other of his fellow rsrc9686."

The town was very prosperous but the rsrc2326 started to demand blood tithes. Then during their time of need rsrc3266 arrived and promised them a solution. He told them to dig directly down until they discovered a pool of green slime and to build a fountain on top of it, later names the rsrc1937. When the townsfolk put the strange green slime and crushed bones into the fountain and worshipped at it, it created a green ghostly barrier that the vampyres couldn't pass which stopped them having to give blood tithes. At the time Necrovarus was hailed a hero. However the fountain started to have a strange effect on the villagers. First it started with lack of hunger and obsession with the Ectofuntus. Over time they all turned into ghosts, and couldn't pass into the next world because of Necrovarus. The town was left in this state for thousands of years, with all the inhabitants left to wonder the remains of what was once a prosperous port. In rsrc2398 the player must get Necrovarus to allow the ghost villagers to pass into the next world. A player must obtain votes from them during the Ghosts Ahoy rsrc132. While signing the petition during Ghosts Ahoy), players can stick to 2 rsrc1313 instead of wandering around the port finding new ghosts. Should players attempt to talk to them after the quest while still wearing a rsrc2397, their character will say \"Wooo wooo woooooooo\", to which the villager replies, \"Sorry, I don't speak ghost.\" After Ghosts Ahoy without a bedsheet on, they say:  The phrase \"We do not talk to warm-bloods\" they sometimes say is possibly a reference to the Harry Potter's mud-bloods, a rude way of referring to people whose both parents were not wizards"

In rsrc2230 quest, he can be found just south-east of the starting point of the rsrc370; look for a ladder to the east of the ramp (between start of the quest and the rsrc17076) that leads to Glough; take this ladder up to find Glough on the second floor. Glough's schemes are thwarted in The Grand Tree quest, and once again in rsrc47. He used to be the head tree guardian of the rsrc1530. He makes his first unsuccessful attempt on the player's life when he summons a rsrc843 to kill them in The Grand Tree, and again in Monkey Madness when it is discovered he has another \"pet\", the rsrc16802, that he uses to further his schemes, which is destroyed by the 10th Squad. During rsrc554, the player manages to break the alliance between Glough and the rsrc17077 by sabotaging rsrc8052 forces, along with his alliance between the ogres and trolls. Becoming increasingly deranged and desperate, Glough launches an attack on the rsrc370 by himself. He eventually meets his end at the hands of the player after a great skirmish, but not before killing rsrc5775. rsrc6482 sends the player on a mission to discover why the Grand Tree is dying. Little do they know that the wheels of Glough's dreams of world domination and hatred of rsrc16681 have been put in motion, he is in the process of preparing an armada of warships to strike at the heart of the human kingdoms. In The Grand Tree, players discover that Glough has hired a man named Charlie to steal the rsrc5079\u2014magic stones kept by one of the original creators of the Grand Tree, rsrc2232, that can be used to wound and even kill the Grand Tree\u2014so that he can frame him as the one who is responsible for the dying Grand Tree. Glough has used these rocks on the roots of the Grand Tree to wound it. In framing Charlie, he attempts to convince King Narnode that humans are trying to destroy the Grand Tree, which the King initially believes. The player eventually finds evidence of Glough's culpability in these plans and discovers that Glough has contracted workers to construct large warships in a distant rsrc4591 to invade the human territories and attempt to control the world. After presenting this evidence to the King and following an investigation of Glough's estate by the King's subjects, the King explains that all they found were a couple of sticks. When the player deciphers the meaning of these sticks and takes them to their intended area, the player finds themselves entrapped by Glough who sets a rsrc843 on them. The player kills the Demon and finds King Narnode at the end of the passage with his troop inspecting the roots and finding the rocks. Under the weight of all of this evidence, King Narnode has Glough placed under house arrest and the player is rewarded for their work. Meanwhile, an angry Glough plots his revenge against the player. King Narnode sends the player to investigate the disappearance of the elite 10th squad, who were tasked with decommissioning the Shipyard where Glough was preparing an armada to attack mankind. It turns out that the 10th Squad crashed on a small island south of Karamja due to powerful winds that damaged their gliders. When most of the squad leaves the island to inspect a nearby atoll that had been spotted prior to the crash, several of them are captured by sentient apes who imprison them. Some of the 10th squad escape. Two conduct espionage while three others work on carrying out a rescue operation for those captured. When rsrc1525 gives the player a puzzle box to solve, the player can alternatively bring it to Glough to have him solve it for them. However, Glough will charge the player 200,000 coins before nearly completing the puzzle for them. The player can ask why he will not complete the puzzle, and he will tell them that it would set off an alarm. In Monkey Madness, players discover that rsrc12453 is continuing Glough's plans for warfare with the humans, in the apparent absence of a confined Glough. rsrc16068, the leader of the apes, is eventually found to be conspiring with Glough's henchmen to attack mankind. By utilizing a technological breakthrough privy only to Glough and his circle, they will be able to teleport all of the 10th squad to an arena with an enormous Jungle Demon to have them killed off. Fortunately, the squad commander, Sergeant Garkor, learns of their intent before they act on it, and with a bit of ingenuity, enables the player to teleport with the 10th squad when it happens. The demon is defeated, and it appears that Caranock's and Awowogei's plans are foiled for the time being. After Monkey Madness, Glough can still be found in his treehouse, and when spoken to, says, \"Mark my words, the monkeys are listening\". This is a hint towards the rsrc554 quest. Glough mysteriously disappears from his house arrest, which prompts King Narnode to send the player to find out what he is plotting. It is shown that rsrc11376 had smuggled him out of house arrest and dropped him off at Ape Atoll. Glough has been experimenting with the monkeys and gorillas of Ape Atoll with an unknown mutagen. rsrc8052 was unaware of this, and had simply labelled it as Kruk's \"secret weapon\". When the player arrives on Glough's barge, Glough tells them (as Kruk) to send the remaining three rsrc2036 back into their cages, as they had broken out. After the gorillas are thrown back into the cage, Glough tells them that the mutagen is almost perfect, and that he is aiming to create a mutagen that makes the applicant more aggressive, but obedient to the controller. He leaves the player to find Le Smith; the player quickly sabotages the onyx charging the mutagen. After finding Le Smith, Glough hears about the monkeys backing off their attack. Despite this, he still continues onward. While on the Barge, the tormented gorillas break out and crash the ship. Glough manages to survive the crash and takes his best \"experiments\" into the cavern. When the player and Nieve arrive, Glough realises that the player had been foiling his plans all along, and sends his two tortured and rsrc2041 at them; however, the player and Nieve are able to defeat them. Glough becomes angered and drinks the remaining mutagen to finish off the player and Nieve. Nieve attempts to stop Glough, but the mutated Glough slams her into a wall and stomps the ground, causing a boulder to crash and kill Nieve. After a very long battle between the mutated Glough and the player, Glough is eventually defeated. However, the caverns become increasingly unstable due to Glough's actions and collapse, presumably killing him. After the quest, Glough can be refought for challenge purposes by gazing into the burning brazier in rsrc2379's house in western Gnome Stronghold. This fight will record the fastest kill time, and offers no rewards. Glough is mentioned in Gnomish language on rsrc1291 page 13. \"Laufata ki Glough ki Ta Quir Priw Undo eso, Tolly, gnomo kar is Glough hamo sarko pro rsrc10745 Qua!\" It has been partially translated as follows with the rsrc2231: \"The eye of Glough of The Guardian Tree Land for, the idiot, no gnome but Glough has begone to become the Stone City Guardian!\" "

During the reign of rsrc13944, a large area of land south of the Gnome Stronghold was to be claimed by the gnomes. A large tribe of goblins also sought to claim the land, and the two soon met in combat. Using his unique brand of rsrc59, he was able to fool the rsrc873 army into believing that the Gnome army had several battle rsrc6736 which sent the Goblins into a panic, giving the vastly outnumbered Gnomes an easy victory, and securing his place as one of King Healthorg's advisors, along with rsrc2232 and rsrc13943. Whilst many Gnomes were grateful for Glouphrie's part in the Gnomish victory, Oaknock was still distrustful of him. During the 4th age, there was a silver rsrc1091 in the rsrc1530 called Argento, who had been befriended by Hazelmere. One day however, Hazelmere noticed that the usually friendly Argento was silent, and his aura had vanished. Hazelmere then went to Oaknock, and together they constructed a machine that would render illusion magic ineffective. Once activated, the machine revealed that Argento had been murdered. As the only one with enough strength to keep the illusion for so long, it became apparent that Glouphrie had hidden the destruction of Argento. Glouphrie was then banished from the Gnome Stronghold by King Healthorg, and so began the Gnomes' distrust of all magic users. "

Several years ago, a group of rsrc16301 in the employment of The Red Axe were conducting an unknown operation on the frozen peak of rsrc4558, the colossal mountain beneath which the dwarves' capital city, rsrc672, is hidden. The dwarves were led by rsrc10743, the violent right-hand man of the company's director, rsrc17082. Whilst wandering the icy land, the dwarves found Grunsh in the snow, at first believing him to be a native rsrc2504. Unconscious, freezing, and on the brink of death, the dwarves soon realised that he was an ogre. Once awake and partially healed, Grunsh could remember nothing. How he came to be so far from the ogre homeland in the rsrc2059 remains a mystery to this day. Grunsh soon proved to be intelligent by ogre standards, capable of casting rsrc59. As dwarves do not use magic, Hreidmar soon saw the value in having a mage on his side and recruited Grunsh as employee #38262. The player infiltrates a hidden Red Axe facility after some time, only to realise that the dwarf's memory was altered by Grunsh. The dwarf, while exploring the mines in which the Red Axe was hidden, discovered that The Red Axe was working with the rsrc172 of rsrc10745 in an effort to gain control of Keldagrim. He was captured by the Red Axe and brainwashed by Grunsh, leaving him with little memory of the incident and craving for rsrc787 and rsrc140. In his now alcoholic state he would not be believed. The player suffers a similar fate; while observing a procession of artificially manufactured rsrc16898, they are caught and brainwashed, leaving them with no memory of their discoveries in the base. They then go on a drunken rave in the rsrc16708 Pub, effectively rendering any remaining memories unbelievable.

She claims to be seven times as old as the number of legs on the stools in the rsrc4345, which would make her either 224, 266, or possibly, 364, depending on whether she is referring to the bar room only, the entire lower level, or both downstairs and upstairs, respectively.  She used to be called just Gypsy, but this was changed so people would know her name is 'Aris', vital information needed for quests. During rsrc484, her name is Gypsy, not Gypsy Aris. During Recipe for Disaster, she refers to herself as the rsrc3109's \"bubbykins\", indicating a possible (maybe past) relationship between the two. During Recipe for Disaster, the rsrc3781 says \"You!\" after spotting Gypsy Aris. This may be an inkling that they have battled before. If a female player talked to Gypsy Aris after rsrc3312 and chose to talk about Demon Slayer, Gypsy Aris would say, \"Greetings young one. You're a hero now. That was a good bit of demon-slaying\", instead of heroine. If you inspect rsrc3508 during Recipe for Disaster, Aris says \"My Gypsy senses are tingling\". This is an obvious reference to rsrc17126 quote \"My spidey senses are tingling!\"."

Recently, the Emir's son and heir to the throne, rsrc3683, was kidnapped by rsrc7371, an infamous mercenary killer known for her underhanded business tactics. Imprisoning Ali in her guarded prison in the forest east of rsrc340, she demanded a massive ransom in exchange for Ali's safe return to Al Kharid. Threatening to cut off his fingers, she awaited the Emir's payment. The Emir, emotionally distressed by the events, hid himself within his secret chambers. In no fit state to rule, the Emir's position was temporarily given to Hassan. Hassan, hoping to save Ali with paying Keli's massive ransom, began to work with rsrc1873, the city's trained spymaster. During the Prince Ali Rescue quest, players help to save Prince Ali with the help of Osman and his daughter, rsrc3684. Once the quest is finished, the Emir and Ali continue to remain hidden.

A hell-rat can be added to the rsrc8819 upon being caught, but will not look any different from a regular rat. Note: A full grown cat has a much higher chance of success at killing hell-rats versus a kitten. Kittens only have about a 5% chance of catching Hell-Rats, and as such are not advised. Hell-rats have a bigger variant, rsrc8458, which will give you a 4-dose spice when succesfully killed. There are 4 Hell-Rat Behemoths around the room, each protecting a different spice, use the respective curtain to obtain the desired spice. Your cat will be killing it for you. It is strongly suggested to bring any sort of fish to heal your cat during the fight. Note that if your cat dies during the fight, you will lose him. A way to save your cat when fearing his death is to run away from the fight. The cat will then follow you again, losing the fight however. It does not matter which type of fish you give your cat during the fight, since they all heal the same quantity of health. "

They guard a 4 dose coloured spice (rsrc5819, rsrc5818, rsrc5820, or rsrc3762) and must be killed in order to obtain it. Hell-Rat Behemoths are caught by having your cat enter the curtains and fight them, just like the rsrc13015 during the rsrc3329 quest. The player will then enter an instanced area where their cat and the rat will face off. The Hell-Rat Behemoth has 15 rsrc65. Should the fight prove to be too difficult, players can walk away to exit the instance with their cat unharmed. The player can give their cat rsrc1187 or rsrc198 to heal them by using them on the curtain. Catching and using rsrc7303 to heal your cat is suggested as they are stackable. It is highly recomended that players use rsrc3763 as they will be able to stand up to the rat much more effectively than a normal rsrc1625 will. If the cat dies during the fight, it is permanently lost and players will have to obtain another kitten from rsrc4221. When successfully defeated, the player will exit the instance and will automatically be given the four-dosed spice that the Behemoth was guarding. If the player's inventory is full, it will be dropped on the floor right under the player. Normal cats instantly become hellcats after killing a behemoth. "

Ultimately, though, his efforts failed, descending into madness at the hands of the plague and never finding an effective cure. His assistant rsrc5347 also fell victim to the disease. The rsrc17138 can still be found in his ruined home in central Mort'ton. It contains information regarding the plague, which may be helpful during the rsrc1617 rsrc15898.

Hofuthand's business requires a good deal of thinking, so he always seems to be deep in thought. Because of this, he doesn't say much about himself; although, based on his clothing, he is almost certainly from the dwarven capital city of rsrc672. It seems he was sent by the rsrc7346 to establish trade with the rsrc2859 in rsrc378. The exact reason for this is unknown, but based on the dwarves' recent involvement with the rsrc2165, it seems that the dwarves seek to establish ties with more of the world's races."

She can be found in two places: Because of her understanding of rsrc17162, she can enchant them into, bows, shields, halberds or saws for a price. Be aware that the current price on the GE might make it more economic to buy from the GE than to re-enchant the seed. If you have a rsrc794, rsrc802, rsrc4995, or rsrc1099 that has reverted to a rsrc4997, Ilfeen can enchant it back to a bow or shield for a price. The price drops by 180,000/150,000 each time you have a seed enchanted into a bow/shield or halberd (respectively), down to a minimum price: Ilfeen will only recharge a crystal item once it fully depletes - you can't recharge the initial item from the end of Roving Elves until it reverts back to a seed. Once llfeen enchants a Crystal seed at least once, she is then able to re-enchant partially degraded crystal equipment, at a proportion of the cost. For example, a Crystal bow in '9/10' condition can be recharged back to full condition for 18,000 coins if the minimum recharge cost has already been reached. Likewise, a Crystal shield in '2/10' condition can be recharged for 600,000 coins if it is the first time Ilfeen is re-enchanting. A recharge in this manner will not count towards reducing the cost for future re-enchantments.  "

Jarvis was a camp counselor at Camp Sapphire Lagoon, and was the sole survivor of Jonas's onslaught on the island. He was the one who had killed Jonas in the past, and did such a number on him that by the time the Grim Reaper came for his soul, his face was unrecognisable, and left his machete wedged in the middle of his face. Due to his involvement in trapping Jonas, he was given a gravestone marked with the letter \"J\" and a scroll with the number 17 with bloody harpoon at the Lumbridge graveyard.  Jarvis Thompson is based on the character rsrc17177 who appears in three of the twelve rsrc16220 films. The harpoon that is resting on the gravestone is the same harpoon that Jonas used."

Players are to trap him in a time bubble with the aid of rsrc4166. According to the rsrc1466, he is the truest of all evil, a kind of evil that simply kills all in his path. He was so intensely evil that the Grim Reaper used his powers to remove all memory of him from the world, except for rsrc4166, in case Jonas ever returned. When Jonas was seventeen years old, his mother, who was a camp counselor over at Camp Sapphire Lagoon, drowned to death during a routine patrol she had done alone. She slipped on the jetty and fell with such force that she knocked herself unconscious and fell into the lake. As counselors were supposed to do patrols in pairs, Jonas blamed the inhabitants of the Camp, and made his way there, killing 65 people on the island, except for Jarvis. Jarvis did such a number on him that by the time the Grim Reaper came for his soul, his face was unrecognisable, and left wedged in the middle of his face was his machete. The name Jonas is an anagram of Jason, which, alongside his appearance, is a reference to rsrc16219 from the rsrc16220 series."

They cannot be fought, although wily rsrc1625 can catch them in much the same way as rsrc4222. This will keep the cat from becoming a lazy cat, although it yields no other reward. Little is known about Kalphite larvae due to the species' highly aggressive nature. Much of what is known of them comes from unprofessional observation or by comparing them to their closest relatives: rsrc700, rsrc17202, rsrc538 rsrc4127, and rsrc8539. More information can be found in the rsrc1217 displays. Larvae are born from small, brown eggs. These eggs are lain by the rsrc17203, the leader of a Kalphite hive. Once a group of eggs are successfully lain, they are taken by rsrc16495, who raise the eggs in special nursery areas within the hive. These eggs will hatch quickly, each yielding a larva. Larvae will develop quickly in order to ensure their hive is fully protected at all times. The exact nature of this development, though, depends on what level of the caste system they were biologically chosen to become at birth. Larvae will develop into either workers, rsrc592, rsrc634 or, in rare cases, a queen. Though there are large differences between the different species of the Kalphiscarabeinae family, the basic evolution process remains the same. Larvae, regardless of what their role in the hive will be, begin the development process by growing six large legs, the two front of which are particularly powerful and designed specifically for tunnelling into the desert sands. Soldiers, guardians, and queens also develop spikes long the length of their legs, which they use for combat and additional maneuverability. At the same time, their soft bodies will begin to harden, gaining powerful plates on their rsrc17204 known as rsrc17205. They gain a green colour at an early age, although its shade and patterns vary greatly based on what its role in the hive will be. As they enter the late stages of development, the larvae will grow two large rsrc17206, which they use to detect movement. The plates will continue to advance and harden, eventually gaining the ability to fan out and detect odors. If the larva is to be a queen, it will also develop powerful spines on its abdomen that can be thrown at foes by thrusting the body upwards. It will also develop a type of magical attack and a holy protection, hinting that the Kalphite may be connected to the desert rsrc16271 rsrc4144. Once fully developed, the now adult Kalphite will unquestioningly take up its role in the hive, building and fighting to protect its species. Should players use a rsrc984 to fight Kalphite workers, the larvae flee from the cannon. Kalphite larvae have the same examine text as rsrc17207."

Waking up, he began to scream in pain and blue foam had been coming out of his mouth. In addition, his eyesight worsened, but was able to see three of the rsrc149 Elders, who wielded green banners. The tallest of them approached him, at the brink of death, claiming that they can save his life, and so they did. However, this came at a cost: he was still blind, and horns began to grow on his head. He was cursed to take on the role of the key master, where he is tasked to prevent rsrc2681, guardian of the river of souls, from escaping the iron gates that hold her.  The Key Master is one of the few human NPCs to have visible \"fingers\"."

Arthur is the leader of the Knights of the Round Table and an ally of the rsrc10285.rsrc274 King Arthur is found on the ground floor and is involved in three rsrc132: rsrc1767, rsrc2290, and rsrc724. After completing the Holy Grail, players can mount a rsrc7405 on a wall in their rsrc156. King Arthur arrived to rsrc3096 in 132 of the rsrc2390, where the Knights of the Round Table were to remain until their aid was needed again in England. (When speaking to the rsrc3005 at the beginning of the rsrc724 quest, when you ask if Arthur and his Knights's disappearance could be due to their returning to their own realm, the guard will enigmatically respond that there is no evidence to suggest that.) At the time, rsrc11804 still held the throne of rsrc536. Once in Gielinor, King Arthur sought to find a new castle to house his Knights. King Ulthas, wishing to aid King Arthur, spoke with rsrc6193, an important political figure who had taken up residence in a mansion east of rsrc725. Sinclair agreed, deciding Arthur's need was greater than his. He left the mansion to Arthur, relocating himself and his children to a small mansion near the southern border of the rsrc10178. His children, though, never forgave him for leaving their home, eventually leading to rsrc1451. King Ulthas died shortly after, leaving the throne to his sons rsrc4567 and rsrc2245. King Lathas, the ruler of rsrc729, disagreed with his father's decision to give the Knights rsrc1766, and to this day wishes to reclaim the mansion and have the Knights killed. To do this, he has allied himself with the rsrc3025 of the rsrc16426 Iorwerth Clan, whom he believes will aid him in his future attack.  In actual ancient medieval and Roman history, rsrc17220 was a legendary figure, around whom a number of stories revolved. King Arthur can be given a poison chalice from rsrc8636, the coal truck manager, to complete an easy rsrc17221. Once given, he quotes the Grail Knight from Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade. The world that Arthur arrived from is presumably our own, as the characters in rsrc1766 are sourced 'as is' from the Matter of Britain and Arthurian Legends. Arthurian legend also states that King Arthur was not truly killed by Mordred, but carried off to another world, biding his time and ready to return. The 'other world' in this case would be rsrc3096."

King Gjuki is the fifth king of the island and the fourth in the Sorvott line. King Sorvott plays a large role in rsrc1613 rsrc15898, which deals with his rivalry with the neighbouring nation of rsrc1611. King Sorvott IV was born to rsrc17223 and his wife. When he was young, his father taught him how to manage the island's rsrc17224 and trade. The young Sorvott possessed a strong interest in market, but overall seems to have absorbed little of his father's teachings. Sorvott IV, like every king of rsrc4559 before him, harboured an intense hatred for the neighbouring island of rsrc1611. Neitiznot, which was founded several hundred years ago by the rsrc3936 rsrc13767, had possessed a violent rivalry with Jatizso since its establishment. Sorvott IV was taught what were largely untrue stories of Neitiznot brutality, and his aggressive nature only heightened his dislike of his neighbours. In his early manhood, his father passed away, and his mother died at an undetermined time as well. This left the throne to the young Sorvott IV, who would use his power to wage war against his neighbours. Sorvott, since coming to power after the death of his father, rsrc17223, has received incredibly poor public reception, his people largely attempting to flee rsrc4559 for the city of rsrc678 in the mainland rsrc10178. He has become engaged in two wars: the rsrc1613 and the rsrc10178. His penchant for increasing tax to sponsor the futile wars against the rsrc564 to the north and rsrc1611 to the west led to the gross mismanagement of his nation's economy and a state of near-permanent bankruptcy. As a result, poverty and widespread unhappiness are rampant among his subjects. King Sorvott IV is portrayed as an extremely stubborn, ignorant, bitter and unwise ruler during the rsrc9148 quest, in stark contrast to his cousin and rsrc1611 counterpart, the recently reformed Burgher rsrc4590. Deluded since young about the neighbouring Neitiznot and coupled with years of intense rivalry between the two hostile nations, he refuses to join forces with them and collaborate together to eliminate a much bigger threat to the north, the rsrc564. He did, however, agree to a grudging truce between them so that they could protect themselves from the Ice trolls. When the player character tries to explain that it is a very bad idea to tax his citizens excessively during the quest, he ignores it and after the quest, the player character starts insulting his stubbornness and ignorance and he becomes very frustrated.  Although he does not wear an rsrc4224, he seems to still understand his cat, rsrc17225."

King Roald is the son of King rsrc17227, a monarch most famous for his efforts to reclaim the Shield of rsrc2167 from the rsrc3594 and rsrc2731. Although little is currently known of King Roald's early history, he is known to have had a pampered upbringing, learning to read from the Palace's librarian, rsrc3333. Since his rise to the position of king, Roald III has been accepted by most as a generally good ruler. Under his rule, the city of rsrc378 has prospered greatly, and has seen the renovation of the rsrc1217. Yet, despite this, there are certain groups that feel Roald is weak in the face of the Church of rsrc1222, and others that would go so far as to see him assassinated. His hesitance in matters such as the recent conflicts with rsrc2264 have earned him many enemies. During the rsrc519 quest, players must visit King Roald to collect a reward for returning the Shield of Arrav to the rsrc1217. Originally, King Roald had no role in the quest, but an update gave him a small part in the quest's ending. You can start the rsrc2265 quest by speaking to King Roald. During the rsrc1163 rsrc15898, he falls under a mind control spell cast by rsrc7098 and is forced to fight against the player. He is level 47 and can only be defeated if the player summons rsrc2342 when he is at zero rsrc65. He is immune to damage from the rsrc1128 spell, rsrc17228 and rsrc296. The same day the quest was released, King Roald's graphics were revamped. If you have completed the rsrc16689 quest, while fighting King Roald, he will shout phrases like \"I'm allergic to roses!\" and \"That garden was awful!\", which is a reference to the quest. If rsrc519 is completed, he will also say, \"A member of the Phoenix Gang?\" In the culmination of rsrc230, players seek his aid at the behest of rsrc13971 and rsrc12821.  Roald is suggested to be greedy - as seen in Shield of Arrav when he pays the player only half of the bounty his grandfather put out to recover the shield, and again in Priest in Peril when he mentions he would have sent a squire to check in on rsrc2262, but all the squires wanted payment for the task."

One such castle was found east of rsrc725, but at the time it was owned by rsrc6193 and his children, who were all very young at the time. King Ulthas and Lord Sinclair eventually decided that King Arthur's need of the castle was greater than the Sinclair family's, and so Lord Sinclair and his family left the castle and moved to rsrc726 to the north (much to his children's displeasure). King Arthur claimed the castle and renamed it rsrc1766. King Ulthas had two children, named Lathas and Tyras. They were both strong and noble boys, so King Ulthas had difficulty deciding which of the two would one day rule rsrc536. It was decided that they would rule Kandarin together. King Ulthas was later killed in a hunting accident in the surrounding forests. King Lathas and King Tyras soon decided that they could not rule Ardougne together, and so the city was split into two halves."

He also occasionally makes decisions for the player when he/she is not there. During rsrc1903, the player has to act as a diplomat between the two fragile nations of rsrc1910 and rsrc1906. Afterward, a treaty from rsrc1908 will be given to King Vargas. Because of his yeti-like features (not to mention size), he cannot sign the treaty with a normal pen. The player must then get a giant pen nib from rsrc6422 and attach it with some logs to make a giant pen for the king. During rsrc2361, he has an argument with rsrc1908 and declares war on rsrc1906. After the quest, the player finds out this is all a big sham, plotted by some teenagers from rsrc678 wishing to complete their trials for adulthood. The player must then give King Vargas a letter from rsrc1908. He doesn't expect what Sigrid wrote to him, as she hinted dating him after he is cured from his yeti state.

During rsrc778, the player was tricked and hypnotised by rsrc4145 to infiltrate his tomb and steal one of the rsrc4143 containing his organs, so that she could steal his soul. When the player tries to leave rsrc13495 after hiding one of her symbols inside one of the sarcophagi, rsrc13497 himself breaks the spell placed on them by Amascut and the player wakes up outside the pyramid without realising what they had done. At this point, Klenter's soul can be seen in the streets of Sophanem, blaming the player for what he had done (although the player will only know what he is saying while wearing a rsrc4964), and everyone in the city (except for the rsrc4225) will turn hostile towards the player for desecrating the tomb. If the player stays near him for too long, he will lose his patience and attack them, dealing a small amount of damage. Later, the player manages to enter the pyramid again (with the help of their rsrc1625) to return the canopic jar they stole earlier, receiving Klenter's gratitude for doing so. After this, the rsrc4146 decides to perform a second embalming ritual for Klenter, during which Amascut attacks the player with a rsrc773 thanks to the symbol the player had unknowingly placed there before, but she fails and runs away to hide. By the end of the quest, it is stated by the High Priest that, unfortunately for the people of Sophanem, Amascut had hypnotised another adventurer (presumably another player starting the quest) immediately after running away from the ritual, to make them do the same things the player had previously done, and for that reason the plagues hadn't been lifted from rsrc450. The High Priest also states that, for as long as she doesn't give up on stealing Klenter's soul, the struggle between rsrc13497 and rsrc4145 would continue forever. If the player speaks to Klenter after the end of the quest, he will thank them for giving his soul some respite. The player's character will want to ask a question, but not before Klenter disappears forever. Interestingly, speaking to him without a ghostspeak amulet will state that he is deeply angry towards the player's actions.  Similar to rsrc2381 and rsrc5463, Klenter cannot be passed through and players will have to manually path around him if he is in the way."

In a snowy, ruin-dotted wasteland north of rsrc946, this heating affected a frozen cavern beneath the remains of an ancient temple left untouched since the ancient rsrc1224. The Temple Knights, who were informed by a rsrc17231 about the dungeon, realised that the now-thawing inhabitants were part of a battle that had been frozen in time over 2,000 years ago. Fearing that the inhabitants could escape from their icy prison, the Temple Knights sent an elite unit of highly-trained soldiers to the dungeon in an effort to assess the situation. Prior to his death, Sir Gerry was able to relay little of what happened within the depths of the caves. The sole survivor of the doomed mission, Gerry lay severely wounded amongst the crumbling masonry of the temple on the surface. Here, freezing to death and threatened by the native rsrc10358, Gerry wrote a letter detailing what they had learned of the God Wars Dungeon: Players, should they visit the area above the dungeon, can speak to Sir Gerry before he dies. Giving them the rsrc7415, he instructs them to deliver it to rsrc1778 in Falador Park. Players can read the letter, which briefly describes the battle and the treasure for which it is being fought, the rsrc1709. Once players deliver the letter, Sir Tiffy will pass it on to his superiors. This yields no reward. Upon returning to the temple ruins, they will find the knight dead, overcome by his injuries.

She is found in the jail area (usually inside the jail proper but sometimes within the jail's compound) in rsrc340. Lady Keli kidnapped rsrc3683 and had plotted to ransom for the prince's release. Keli is vain and arrogant - she likes showing off and being praised, and claims to have killed three men before she was six (there is no evidence to support this claim apart for her word). The player exploits these traits to outwit her - tricking her into showing the key to Prince Ali's cell, which allows the player to get a clay imprint and make a bronze copy of the key. The player incapacitates her head guard, rsrc11213, before tying Keli up with a rsrc1609, locking her in a closet and freeing Prince Ali. Once the player has completed the quest, speaking to her will result in being attacked by one of her rsrc11212.  When the rsrc132 was released, the chain on Lady Keli's neck (holding the key to rsrc3683's cell) was made out of the strongest metal available at the time, rsrc496. In the upgrade from rsrc4783 to RuneScape the chain's material was changed to rsrc9112 to reflect runite's quality as a stronger metal. It was hinted before the quest that her sister is rsrc10021 (the leader of the rsrc2731 in rsrc378). This would make her full name Keli Raven. Once finished with the quest (rsrc1805) if spoken to, she will demand the guards to kill you. She will say: \"You, you're the one who tricked me and tied me up! Guards - Kill this stranger!\" and the guards say: \"Yes, M'Lady\". Before completing Prince Ali Rescue, she says she may hire you when you are stronger, but she will never hire you."

He is located inside the rsrc5756 in the elven land of rsrc4548. He is involved in the entire rsrc178 series storyline. Players might also need to see him as part of a rsrc15903. He is considered one of the evil elves, with the Iorwerth family having taken over rsrc2613 years ago. It is believed that Lord Iorwerth broke one of the nine seals of the rsrc17258, made by rsrc4992 the elven goddess. The nine seals were used to protect the vast knowledge kept there from reaching the hands of humans. The library is located underneath the elven city of Prifddinas, which is currently inaccessible. However, the reason for his actions is unknown. It is revealed during the rsrc495 quest that Iorwerth is in league with rsrc4567, the latter one being tricked by Iorwerth, having convinced rsrc4567 that he will help him conquer Camelot. He gives a rsrc5004 to you during Regicide so you can prove you are working for him. Iorwerth is the leader of the Iorwerth Clan, which has established itself as a sworn enemy of rsrc2245. Iorwerth is an influential person and obviously has power, as he virtually controls rsrc4548 with the help of the rsrc23 military. For those requiring to speak to Lord Iorwerth as part of a Treasure Trail, it is worth noting that the minimum agility required to reach him is 45. This is required to attempt to cross the log just south of his camp. An rsrc5755 would take you directly to him. Lord Iorwerth is also involved in the Civil War of rsrc4548. During the Fourth Age of Gielinor, the elves expanded their kingdom far to the East, over the mountains of Arandar. After many years of establishments they suddenly stopped receiving any news from Prifddinas. Worried about the problem, the current leaders of the Cadarn family decided to send six scouts to check what was going on in Tirannwn. After many months out of the six scouts only one returned with terrible news. The Iorwerth Clan had taken over the city of Prifddinas chasing away all of the other clans. A civil war started in rsrc4548 which divided the population into two factions, the Iorwerth Clan and the Rebel Elves.  If you speak to Lord Iorwerth wearing full mourner gear, he will say, \"What are you doing here? You will ruin everything...Get back to Ardougne now.\" \"Iorwerth\" is an anagram for \"worthier\"; he is referenced in a Treasure Trail riddle that states \"There is no 'worthier' lord\". His name is likely derived from Iorwerth, a once rather common Welsh name."

Some years ago, rsrc1437 and the Knights of the Round Table arrived in rsrc3096 from rsrc15527. Once there, they realized they were in need of a castle. King Ulthas, the king of Kandarin at the time, met with Lord Sinclair and discussed King Arthur's plight. After much discussion, Lord Sinclair decided that he would give his castle to King Arthur and relocate him and his family to a large mansion in the north, near the southern border of the rsrc10178. He renamed the mansion rsrc726. King Arthur, meanwhile, renamed the castle rsrc1766. Lord Sinclair's children were unhappy with the turn of events, however, and believed that they deserved Camelot more than King Arthur. From that day forward, they held a strong grudge against their father. Many years later, Lord Sinclair was found stabbed to death in the mansion. One of his children was convicted and imprisoned in the courthouse in Seers' Village. It was later revealed, however, that Lord Sinclair's murder was part of a longer chain of events devised by two of his children in order to reclaim Camelot from King Arthur. "

Alternatively, a rsrc7796 may be used in place of the 3,000 coin fee. Approximately every 10 seconds, they will switch genders.

Players who had linked their Twitch Prime account to their Runescape account between 26 July and 19 September rsrc231 had early access to an additional purple skin colour. This skin colour was made available to everyone in rsrc17285 on 20 September 2018. The Make-over mage is also sometimes required in the rsrc128 quest, where the player must defeat someone that no man can defeat. If they are male, they must go to the Make-over mage and become female. After the quest, they will be reimbursed for the 3,000 coin fee, and be given a makeover voucher, which can be used for one free makeover. The mage was invited to rsrc6353's celebration of the rsrc123 of rsrc1469, for which the player had to complete the riddle of \"How many major accidents have I had this month when attempting to use my make-over powers?\", to which the answer was \"36\".

Mortifer will often try to raise the dead, but sometimes fails and creates fungus. He never summons fungus twice in a row. Occasionally, he will summon a rsrc1328, rsrc17286, rsrc3711 or a rsrc17287. They will follow Mortifer if the necromancy is successful. If a player annoys him, he will cast a spell, unblockable by the best Magical protection or even by the rsrc5495 prayer, to temporarily transform the player into a mushroom.  He takes part in the rsrc913 and rsrc4858 rsrc132. Mortifer calls himself a 'great practitioner' and a 'master' of the magic arts, he once triumphed over rsrc5565, and is known to the Dark Wizard rsrc9867. Mortifier also possesses knowledge of the rsrc217. After the Swan Song quest, he will spare a player a rsrc3758 and he will give rsrc915 if the player has a rsrc17125 with a rsrc916. If you speak to him after you have completed the rsrc256 rsrc16002, he will let on that he is a follower of rsrc1220 and he will tell you about the burning of the rsrc2224. Given that he knows about what you did for the rsrc11692, he is probably a member of that organisation himself. Malignius is one of the few NPCs that can summon creatures, though if you speak to him about it, he will tell you that rsrc11817 has nothing to do with summoning. He also mentions that rsrc15089 (summons rsrc2432), rsrc11801 (at the rsrc11808), rsrc2818 (from the quest rsrc315) and rsrc7360 (in rsrc6397; necromancy drove him mad) are, or were, necromancers. Apparently, he had \"a slight accident involving a bottle of Super-Ultra-Flora-Growth-Potion\" which resulted in the creation of the rsrc17288. He also sells rsrc4056 for 40,000 coins after defeating rsrc5565 in rsrc4858. In the rsrc4303, players are required to give him rsrc3976, Draynor Manor rsrc4035 and a rsrc2321 in exchange for a rsrc6795.  Malignius Mortifer is Latin for Deadly Wickedness. When trying to summon his creatures, Mortifer speaks in Latin. When you talk to him with an item aligned to rsrc1222, rsrc2168 or rsrc1220 and ask him if necromancy is similar to summoning, he will answer back with different responses: Saradomin: \"Saradominist Fool! You will get no secrets from me!\" Zamorak: \"Although I note your respects for our Lord Zamorak, I am afraid the subtle secrets of necromancy must remain beyond your grasp.\" Guthix: \"Deluded lover of Guthix, you will get no secrets from me!\" Note: This works even with void knight armour, as the rsrc12238 are followers of Guthix.  If you don't wear anything aligned to them, he says: \"The obscure magical art of necromancy has nothing to do with Summoning.\" and he explains why. Saradomin: \"Saradominist Fool!

He will refuse to give you bone seeds or a brown apron if you have an item of Saradomin worn or in the inventory. When trying to give Mortifer an item, he replies \"Oi - Stop waving your items at me!\" Malignius Mortifer is the creator of the Giant Mole."

As the master of rsrc352, Martin sells the rsrc4060 to players who have reached level 99 in Farming for a price of 99,000 rsrc321. He can be pick-pocketed for seeds at level 38 rsrc1870, for 43 rsrc19. If players fail, he will say, Cor blimey, mate! What are ye doing in me pockets?, and they will take a small amount of damage (varies depending on the player's current rsrc65) and be rsrc3080 for 5 seconds. Pickpocketing Martin offers the same seeds regular rsrc1894 offer. Sometimes, Martin wanders into the pigpen, and the gate is closed by players. This traps him, and restricts his field of movement, thus making him easier to pickpocket. This also prevents the rsrc15119 from entering. Warning: Pickpocketing any character with a \"talk to\" option will delay progressing on actions that require you to talk to them. Furthermore, stealing from area stalls can invoke the delay also. It is rumoured that the delay is 30 minutes. During the quest series, players learn that Martin and several other gardeners are part of the rsrc2074. As gardeners, they tend to farming patches, and usually demand payment for their services. During the quests rsrc4858 and rsrc4587, Martin features at the start of the quests. In Part 1, he talks about how none of his crops are growing, and requests the player to ask the other farmers why this is the case. After killing rsrc5565, players will inform Martin that it would be okay to grow his crops. In Part 2, Martin says that he is surprised that the player came to him after they had \"apparently\" lied to him about how the crops will grow. "

Burowgar is a direct descendent of rsrc13767, the rsrc3936 who established Neitiznot some four generations ago. Mawnis, although technically a king, is referred to in the game as a rsrc17301. Mawnis is the cousin of rsrc9040, ruler of the neighbouring island of rsrc4559 and direct descendent of its founder, rsrc13771. As a result, the two harbour a bitter rivalry that has resulted in an armed conflict between the two. After completing rsrc1613 quest, players will be rewarded with Mawnis' rsrc4545. Should they lose it, they can re-buy it for 50,000 rsrc321. Mawnis Burowgar is the fifth ruler of rsrc1611, and has ruled it well for many years. Unlike rsrc4559, the fertile ground and relatively good climate of Neitiznot have allowed it to flourish for centuries. Until recently, Mawnis was much like his cousin: bitter, violent, and generally unwise as a leaderrsrc274. However, less than a year ago, a war-like band of rsrc564 arrived on one of the archipelago's northernmost islands, and have since pushed their way south. Whilst Jatizso's militia was prepared for the attacks, Neitiznot's rsrc11912 were not. Under the cover of darkness, a number of trolls managed to pass Neitiznot's borders. They mercilessly pillaged the western half of the island, burning down a number of homes and killing anyone they encounteredrsrc2761. Although they were eventually forced out of Neitiznot by the Guard, the island suffered heavy casualties. Amongst those killed were Mawnis' wife and young sonrsrc5332. Since this time, Mawnis has changed, softened by the murder of his family. Deciding that the rivalry between the two islands must be temporarily put aside, Mawnis and rsrc17302 agreed to a grudging truce so that they could focus on protecting themselves from the trolls. His kindness has not been lost upon his subjects, who today are happy and more supportive of him. During rsrc1613 rsrc15898, players help Mawnis remove the threat of the ice trolls by killing rsrc5216. "

She has many magical powers, including some that surpass even rsrc6856's ability. Morgan Le Faye came to rsrc3096 in the rsrc2390, when the portal between England and RuneScape was opened up. She established the keep with her son, and gathered followers, who became the rsrc11304. She waited her time and began devising plots to destroy rsrc1437. Morgan Le Faye hunts down rsrc6856 and traps him in a crystal, to weaken the rsrc17115. Merlin is found and taken back to rsrc1766. An adventurer finds out, and agrees to help the Knights, by first infiltrating her keep. Her son attacks the Adventurer in the keep, but before the final blow is delivered she appears and begs for the player not to kill her son and in turn reveals how to free Merlin. Angered at her failure, she begins planning again. After entering a deal with the Black Knights, they storm Camelot and capture the knights. According to the deal, Morgan gets the knights if she turns King Arthur into stone for the Black Knights to take home. She locks them in her jail. She also gets the Adventurer who stopped her plans last time. However, the entire plan backfires when the player frees the knights, ending in the slaughter of the Renegade Knights and the freeing of King Arthur. There has been no sight of her since. Her only ability is her powerful Magic powers. She is able to sense her son's danger and teleport anywhere. She is able to turn people into stone. She can hold her own against the very powerful Merlin and then trap him in a Crystal. She is able to knock people out with a spell very easily. Other than that, not much is known.  If you interrupt the conversation then talk to her you will get the message \"Nothing interesting happens.\" Morgan Le Faye is based on the character Morgan le Fay from the King Arthur legend. In the legend, she is Arthur's half-sister through their mother, Igraine. After Arthur declared that he was going to rule a Christian kingdom rather than the preferred religion, Paganism, Morgan le Fay sends her sister (and Arthur's half-sister too), Morgause, in disguise to seduce Arthur yielding her pregnancy. Arthur's illegitimate son's name was Mordred, as in RuneScape, however, Mordred is Morgan le Faye's son. This son was meant to be held over Arthur's head as he rules."

    "article-text": "Mother Mallum - Mahey'ish Medron in the ancient, all but forgotten, rsrc1222 language - is the queen of the rsrc17009 and resembles an enormous mollusk, and she plans to take over rsrc15920. She currently has control of the rsrc4700 and rsrc887. She first reveals herself to the world during rsrc891 rsrc15898 when the player is unknowingly tricked into releasing her. She attempted to conquer RuneScape over 4000 years ago but was stopped by the rsrc12061. She communicates using a human body as a host, and during the last part of the Slug Menace quest, she tries to obtain the player character as a new host. The player is ultimately saved from her by being teleported out of the cave by rsrc4807. How Mother Mallum came to be is unknown, and the earliest records of her are the Temple Knights' HQ, which cannot have been written earlier than the middle-to-late rsrc1760. However, the Slug Queen is known to be much, much older than that, due to the fact that she invaded realms before rsrc3096.rsrc15711 She had attempted to achieve global domination on rsrc3096 in the late rsrc5486 or early rsrc2390, having accomplished this in other worlds,rsrc15711 by possessing various important political figures, but this plot was narrowly stopped by the Temple Knights. She was imprisoned, but escaped in the rsrc2390, when she was permanently defeated, ending the rsrc17320. At an unspecified date in rsrc3096 history, described as \"centuries ago\", Mother Mallum emerged from the sea with an army of slugs. Mallum, who had set her plans to possess the important political figures of the world and thus rule it in motion, was fought by both a secretive military organisation known as the rsrc12061 as well as the rsrc10285, a closely linked organisation who served the Temple Knights. rsrc2761 The White Knights suffered massive losses, losing many men to Mother Mallum's mind control, whom she took with her to her base of operation: a large submarine fortress known as the rsrc17321, located off the coast of what is now rsrc536 (more precisely, east of rsrc23). The few knights that had escaped the slugs proceeded to devise a method to remove the possession, which succeeded albeit with great effort, before forming a plan to stop her - the Temple Knights launched a crusade to the Slug Citadel although they soon realised they would not be able to kill her, They fought the slugs and lured Mother Mallum into a cave. There, she was trapped and the knights magically sealed the cave with a door using modified rsrc884. rsrc5332 Mother Mallum was imprisoned and her slugs fled to the depths of the sea, while the Temple Knights marked their victory by building statues of their men which they placed near the door. Additionally, they wrote the name of the prisoner, \"Mahey'ish Medron\", on the door in glyphs. Mother Mallum's second attempt at conquest would not commence until later, in rsrc17322 of the rsrc2390. That year, the rsrc536 government authorised the construction of a rsrc4700 off the coast of the small and quiet fishermen's village of rsrc887. [source needed] The rich catch from the platform brought poverty to Witchaven, which had lost its only source of income. However, the fishermen soon began catching increasing amounts of rsrc8471. These naturally possessed the fishermen, who, as a result, began hauling in only more slugs, while throwing all the caught fish back into the sea.rsrc5330 Eventually, nearly all the workers of the platform, aside from the timid keeper of the platform named rsrc5185, who discovered he could keep the hostile fishermen at bay using fire. Witchaven's mayor, rsrc17323, also fell victim to the slugs' mind control. When the villager rsrc9280 and his son rsrc13490 went to the platform, the sea slug invasion was first discovered. They found themselves unable to leave the platform, but were rescued by the player who was sent by Kent's wife rsrc13483. Afterwards, the sea slugs quickly spread, taking over most of the villagers, aside from the families of Caroline, the sailor rsrc13478, and the fishmonger rsrc8474. Meanwhile, a retired but still semi-active rsrc16893 colonel called rsrc17324 noticed the increasingly strange occurrences and contacted the headquarters in rsrc437 when he noticed the mayor, who \"was about as religious as a dead dog on a termite mound\", had suddenly decided to renovate the shrine to rsrc1222 just west of the village, bringing lots of rsrc21 equipment and, much more suspiciously, high amounts of rsrc833 in. The Knights' head of recruitment, rsrc1778, dispatched an rsrc17325 knight (i.e. the player during the rsrc3573 quest), who had rescued Kennith earlier, to Witchaven to investigate the situation. By this time, the slugs had possessed large groups of rsrc5186, who turned very aggressive as a result. The green rsrc597 proceeded to guard the path to Mother Mallum's prison. They reported to O'Niall and had rsrc4807, the senior mystical researcher, scan the mayor, detecting two life forms (him and his slug), although she initially thought it was an error of the analysis. They then investigated the rsrc17326 and found the Temple Knight prison, not knowing what it was. They had it investigated and found out about the crusade and that Mother Mallum was inside. Soon after, the mayor placed a slug on rsrc2926's neck and commenced a plot to release Mother Mallum. The possessed priest tricked the initiate into repairing the Holy Book of Saradomin, which supposedly stated how to re-inforce the sealing enchantment. While gathering the book's lost pages, they also discovered that O'Niall had been possessed as well. The initiate repaired the book and performed the ritual, but was shocked when it actually opened the prison. Mayor Hobb, now transformed into an aquatic creature, emerged from it and summoned the rsrc10991 to kill the initiate, but the prince was slain. An enraged Hobb was then dismissed by Mother Mallum herself, who cast a rsrc17327 to prevent Savant from rescuing the initiate. She attempted to discard rsrc17328 and use the terrified initiate as her new host. As she was about to attack them, Savant managed to teleport the panicking initiate to safety. They reported to Sir Tiffy, who promoted them to rsrc16240 and ordered the assassination of O'Niall. Mother Mallum is described by the rsrc12061, whom she has fought, as a great evil due to her and her slugs' ability to attach themselves to someone's neck and take over their mind, effectively turning their victims into mindless servants that do her bidding. The victim's skin also turns to a sickly yellow colour, and longer possession results in certain \"aquatic\" features, such as gills and fins, developing. If freed from possession, the victims are unable to recount what had happened, and their mind is left in its state prior to the possession. She is unable to communicate with non-slugs without a host. Unlike her spawn, she is large and powerful enough to carry her host, suspended by tendrils protruding from her mouth, rather than vice versa. Her last host was originally a small girl named rsrc17328, but her body aged over many decades, though her mind remained the same due to her possession. Mother Mallum is cruel and confident, deeming her plans impossible to fail, and sometimes refers to herself in plural, a trait shared by other slugs and victims. Aside from the mind possession, Mother Mallum is capable of telepathy and telekinesis, and perhaps other types of rsrc59 as well, for she is known to be able to cast rsrc5205.  The name \"Mallum\", translated from Latin, means \"evil (thing)/disaster\" (although the Latin word is spelled with one L), thus making her, quite appropriately, the mother of evil. In the rsrc17329 game rsrc16769, set during the rsrc1224, one of rsrc1220's monsters is a rsrc8471, although it resembles Mother Mallum more than it resembles the common sea slug."

The adventurer taught My Arm how to farm, and helped him defend against a rsrc17338 and rsrc17339 who attempted to eat the goutweed. My Arm gained a Farming level as he picked the goutweed, and began growing goutweed to sate the mountain trolls' appetite for them.

To ensure the trolls could still grow goutweed, he taught rsrc12241 how to farm before departing.

My Arm soon falls in love with Mother's daughter, rsrc11705, but Mother disapproves. My Arm, with Snowflake, rsrc11713 and the adventurer's assistance, \"kill\" the rsrc3109, but Mother sees through their ruse and mortally wounds Odd Mushroom. They later break out of the prison and confront Mother, who the adventurer slays in battle.

Nestor is most famed for discovering the rsrc467, a massive series of frozen caverns that played host to one of the last battles of the rsrc1224. According to his notes, Nestor caught word of a ruined temple complex in the icy north of the rsrc10562. Looking to find what treasure it may hold, Nestor travelled into the depths of the rsrc2504-infested mountain range. The mountains' dangers overcame him several times, forcing him to seek alternative routes. Overcome by snowdrifts and stone-throwing troll sentries, he was forced to seek a path through the rsrc464. Although he did find a path, he was unable to traverse it. This path is actually a one-way rsrc505 rsrc17346 available to players. Nestor eventually found a path beneath a massive boulder north of rsrc946. What he found were the ruins of a temple destroyed during the end of the God Wars. Not content with exploring the surface, however, he discovered a rift in the temple's centre. He lowered himself into its depths, unaware of what he would find. Within the dungeon Nestor found hundreds of warriors and beasts fighting, engaged in a battle that had started over 4,000 years ago. Frozen for millennia, they had once more resumed their battle. Fearing for his life, Nestor left the rift. Nestor left the Troll Country fairly easily, although he did encounter several undead trolls travelling north on his way back. He soon returned to Keldagrim, where his notes were left in the city's expansive library. Here they sat untouched for some time. Peregrine left Keldagrim soon after to continue his explorations. His notes mention that he was planning to travel south of rsrc2366 to the rsrc2249. Some speculate that he will appear in-game in the future, perhaps becoming involved with the nearby rsrc172 city of rsrc10745. The God Wars Dungeon was first mentioned in the explorer's notes. The dungeon itself would not be released for some time after their addition. Despite Peregrine's mention of zombie trolls, they do not appear in the God Wars Dungeon. The rsrc17347 is a real world bird known for its high velocity dives. They are the fastest animals alive."

He is also among the strongest demons in the game. At the start of each fight he drains a player's prayer points. Like all demons, he is also vulnerable to the effects of rsrc2789, rsrc1321, rsrc1324, and rsrc2534. He has a very peculiar habit of calling the player 'Vacu'. According to the Shaman rsrc190 'Vacu' was the name for the evil priests who served the 'demons of the underworld'. Despite being a black demon, he is not considered one for the purpose of a rsrc3482. He can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete, but will not drain prayer points there. Nezikchened has possessed rsrc190, the shaman of the rsrc2948. Players must use the book of binding on him to reveal his true form. He will then drain the player's prayer and use melee on them. He can be easily defeated if they drink a prayer potion and then use protect from melee. Stabbing him with Silverlight, Darklight, or throwing a vial of holy water at him can weaken him. This is thought to be the easiest of Nezikchened's three phases, as it is very predictable and only one prayer will be needed. Nezikchened appears again disguised as the ghost Echned Zekin, an anagram for Nezikchened, and will ask players to kill the spirit rsrc3100. Players who do so will save time but will have to fight rsrc4438, rsrc4435, and rsrc4436 at the final part of the quest. Players who do not kill Viyeldi will not have to face these foes, and will receive a rsrc5133 card from rsrc190, which also will weaken him. Whichever path they choose, when players return to Echned Zekin, he will turn into Nezikchened and fight the player. This time he drains the player's prayer unless they use the holy force spell card on him. He uses a weak magic attack at first, then switches to melee. This fight is relatively similar to the first one, in terms of difficulty. At the end of the quest, players must fight the demon one last time. He uses a powerful magic attack and melee, and again he drains prayer at the beginning. A possible way to defeat him involves drinking a prayer potion, using protect from magic, and hiding in the trees with a ranged weapon. If players chose the \"short\" route during the quest, he will also spawn rsrc4438, rsrc4435 and rsrc4436 one at a time in an attempt to weaken the player. After the player has delivered the final blow to Nezikchened, he will exclaim \"I am beaten by a mere mortal...I will revenge myself upon you!\" and the player automatically and sarcastically responds \"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Heard it all before\" right before Nezikchened bursts into flames and dies as he burns into ashes. Nezikchened uses two attacking styles; melee if you are close-up and a black magical attack from a distance. The demon is somewhat resistant to magic and ranged. If a player takes too long to kill him, he will teleport away, forcing you to restart the battle. Melee attacks with a dragon weapon and protect from melee turned on work well in dispatching him quickly. Some prayer potions are necessary to fight Nezikchened because he will reduce your prayer points to around a tenth of whatever prayer points you have remaining. Nezikchened has the ability to hit through protect from melee, however, the chance of this happening is so low, it will probably occur only once during the quest. It is recommended the player keep their life points above 20 at all times. For battle 1: Nezikchened uses his prayer drain in only one hit, and it is at the beginning. You will still have enough prayer points to use protect from melee for a few seconds, and those are the seconds to use your prayer potions. His defence, which is the only combat stat that matters if you use prayer, is not very high. Battle 2: Some players have reported that the demon doesn't even use his magic attack at all in the fight. Even if he does, it will only be 1-2 attack, so protect from melee can be used throughout the battle, as long as you have a little food. If the player fights Nezikchened from a distance while protecting from magic, he may throw a dagger (if the player took the short route and used the obsidian dagger) which may do some amount of damage, although there is a chance the player will dodge this attack. Assuming he uses the attack, the demon will only throw the dagger once throughout the course of the fight. Battle 3: This is the hardest battle. Initially, Nezikchened gets a few free strikes at you and he will also attack when the player is helpless during the intermissions between each warrior (if the short route was taken) but these strikes can be negated with protect from melee. After that, if you are using melee, he won't even bother using magic, so protect from melee can be held. However, the one time that Nezikchened usually hits through protect from melee tends to be in this last battle. "

She only assigns rsrc16024 to players with a rsrc173 of at least 85. Nieve wields a rsrc275, full rsrc2103, an rsrc1075, a rsrc758, an rsrc5539, and a rsrc6107. She has made an appearance with a rsrc649 in rsrc2613 during rsrc1469's first rsrc124 along with other rsrc16751. Nieve is the solution to the medium rsrc4568: I EVEN. The answer to her challenge is 2. Nieve has many cousins, all of whom operate slayer task only areas, like her. rsrc10279 resides in the rsrc17350 and controls the upper level in the rsrc410 area. rsrc14132 and rsrc14131 operate out of the rsrc2922, controlling the rsrc553 and rsrc708 areas, respectively. rsrc7424 oversees rsrc7425. rsrc11931 runs a separate rsrc17351 area in the rsrc3524, and is the older brother of Pieve and Steve. Lastly, Nieve's uncle rsrc14680 maintains the rsrc9538. After rsrc554, Steve moves to the Gnome Stronghold and takes over Nieve's role, and rsrc14741 takes over Steve's role in the Asgarnian Ice Dungeon. In rsrc554, she is recruited by the player to stop rsrc4312 and his experiments from running amok after his airship crashed north of the rsrc1530. Nieve helps the player against the rsrc2036 invading the Stronghold. After the rsrc11675 secures the Stronghold, she, along with the player, pursue Glough in the rsrc2039, where she assists the player in defeating Glough's tortured and rsrc2041. She is ultimately killed by a mutated Glough when he knocks her back to a wall, causing a boulder to fall and crush her. After the quest, her gravestone can be found between the small swamp and the rsrc370's north-western entrance, next to the exit that leads to the Crash Site Cavern. Her gravestone also functions as the player's rsrc10623 for tortured and demonic gorillas. Her younger cousin, rsrc10279, replaces her as the rsrc16096, and rsrc14741 replaces her brother at the rsrc3170. Players can receive rsrc293 for completing rsrc3482\u2014this is based on how many tasks players have accomplished in a row. Completion of a task assigned by Nieve will grant you: Completing all of the elite tasks in the rsrc1255 will increase the rsrc285 points awarded by Nieve to match those of rsrc7309 (15 per task, 75 per 10th, 225 per 50th, 375 per 100th, 525 per 250th, and 750 per 1,000th). Unlocking abilities to increase your rsrc16024 numbers for certain rsrc16572 can be done by spending rsrc293 from any rsrc1956.  (XX) rsrc173 Prior to an update on 17 September 2015, Nieve did not wield an rsrc5539. In addition, her old examine text was shared with other rsrc1956, which was \"She looks dangerous!\" Originally, Nieve wore an rsrc1081. This was likely an oversight by the developers as it was later changed to an rsrc1075. Nieve's examine text implies that she purchased some or all of her equipment on the rsrc490. \"Nieve\" is an archaic Scottish term for a clenched fist. It also means \"snow\" in Spanish. Nieve seems to be very skilled; she wears some of the most powerful equipment available to players and guards the rsrc6117. Furthermore, she is able to telepathically communicate with players inside the cave, preventing them from attacking monsters outside of their slayer assignments. This suggests that she has a scrying pool or some sort to watch the entire dungeon. Most of the rsrc16020 in the cave are also not found around the local area, suggesting that she may have captured them. After completing all of the elite tasks in the rsrc1255, the difference between Nieve and rsrc7309 is that she assigns rsrc3529, rsrc975, and rsrc7349 and doesn't assign rsrc609. After recruiting her during rsrc554, Nieve is shown to have a combat level of 126."

Political unrest within Asgarnia has recently driven Prince Anlaf to drop from the public eye. Concerned with the possibility of assassination or capture, Anlaf has for some time governed Burthorpe behind closed doors. Anlaf does not appear in the game, although he is referred to by several characters. He appears in the first rsrc15920 novel, rsrc17405. Prince Anlaf was born to King Vallance and his wife some time around 130 or 140 of the rsrc2390, although no specific date has ever been given regarding his birth. As Prince Anlaf progressed into young adulthood, his father felt the time had come for him to experience leadership first-hand. King Vallance gave his son lordship of the town of Burthorpe, a small settlement near the border of the rsrc10562. It is possible that Vallance felt that Burthorpe's close proximity to the hostile rsrc2504 of the north would give his son a trying but necessary experience in governing. For years Anlaf ruled Burthorpe, raising the rsrc13033 as its primary defence against the trolls in the north, beginning the Burthorpe - Troll Country War. The city's palace was fortified to better resist siege, while a massive series of tunnels and hidden chambers were created beneath it under Anlaf's supervision. In 169, Anlaf opened what was formerly the private rsrc1781 to the public. Here he hopes that gamers from all over rsrc3096 will engage in friendly competition.rsrc274"

The gnomes are a diplomatic race, and their desire to establish ties with the rsrc7346 is understandable. rsrc6482 has sent Professor Mangelthorp to Keldagrim, so the gnomes can gain a greater understanding of the dwarves' steam-engine technology, which the Consortium has worked to develop in the last 500 years. Professor Mangelthorp is particularly interested in the rsrc16072, a large machine capable of smelting mass amounts of ore with great efficiency. He has also expressed interest in the rsrc17410 transportation network, which he believes could be useful in reaching mining sites. Professor Mangelthorp's main purpose is as a customer in the rsrc960 rsrc15988. In this minigame, players must deliver a random item to certain gnomes created through the use of rsrc2304. To access Keldagrim and thus reach Manglethorp, players must have started rsrc3376 rsrc15898; however, there are no requirements to do this. Please note that the amounts of the rewards are incomplete and are being updated with the variable range of the items given. Tips:"

For most of her early life, she learned to bake and work at her father's rsrc3506. As she reached adulthood, Ramara realised she had no passion to bake for her father. The city's high crime rate meant that the stall's profits were low, and she found she was spending long hours baking and doing her father's accounting. Looking for adventure, she found work in the Piscatoris Fishing Colony, where former Ardougnite rsrc13410 had established a successful rsrc3982-catching industry. Ramara found that she loved both rsrc508 and the ocean, and today still works in the Colony. Despite a rsrc913 involving a rsrc2488 attack, Ramara has no intention of leaving.

    "article-text": "Hreidmar, the Red Axe Director is the villainous director of rsrc9684, a company that had positioned itself as the most powerful company in the rsrc17432 in an attempt to achieve dictatorship over rsrc672, and the true heir to the throne. He follows rsrc1220 and is the main antagonist of the rsrc17433. Hreidmar lived in Keldagrim, the dwarven capital city, until his company left the Consortium, which is when he resorted to hiding in rsrc17434 in abandoned rsrc4870. The dwarf owns a rsrc13175, whom he allows to roam his office freely. Hreidmar was born in 21 or 22 of the rsrc2390 to the director of the rsrc16549. His family was presumably rich, living in rsrc672 West, due to the large influence and wealth of the company. At some point, the dwarf inherited leadership of the Red Axe from his father and, under him, the company would expand massively. Hreidmar ruled with an iron fist, eliminating opposition whenever it arose. Many small companies were forced out of business by his actions, and many dwarves were left unemployed. However, many dwarves flocked to his service, feeling that his method of rule was superior to that of the other companies. Before long, he had gained a very significant following within the city, although his power was not so great that he could oppose the rest of the rsrc7346. However, Hreidmar secretly plotted against the city, gradually formulating a complex plot to claim the city. He found out about the existence and nature of rsrc16898: those dwarves who succumbed to a curse rsrc1220 had placed upon them in the rsrc17435, which would turn them into mindless and dangerous rsrc597 of chaos. The rsrc17436 had worked around this curse at the cost of losing rsrc59 permanently, but Hreidmar was able to find out that the cure could be undone, allowing the curse to take over a dwarf once more and enabling him to create an army of dwarves. Towards the late rsrc2390, he forged a secret alliance with the dark rsrc16850 of rsrc10745 and received special warping machines used by the Arposandrans through their cruel emissary rsrc17437. These would turn his victims into chaos dwarves. However, the method was imperfect, because the chaos dwarves were still unable to use Magic. Hreidmar discovered a rsrc16633 that would return Zamorak's curse completely, but this would turn him and everyone in the vicinity into a chaos dwarf as well, effectively becoming a suicide method. He established a network of spies in and around Keldagrim, such as rsrc11868, owner of a rsrc673 in the rsrc952. He also built a very large network of caves and storerooms to serve as the Red Axe Base in abandoned mines south of the city, using special mine cart tracks to prevent access to them. After the gruesome rsrc17438, Hreidmar took the mentally unstable rsrc10743 under his wing. Laneel then provided them with rsrc10742, a particularly powerful rsrc2500 he had brutally kidnapped from rsrc4237 and forced to erase his own memories. On the gnome's advice, Hreidmar convinced the ogre that he had been rescued from rsrc4558, where he had been found frozen, to which Grunsh swore loyalty to the Red Axe in gratitude, wiping the Red Axe's victims' memories before their conversion to chaos dwarf. With two new allies, Hreidmar began kidnapping dwarves from the poor Keldagrim East, knowing they would not be missed. Additionally, he began expanding his already massive chaos army with rsrc17439, terrifying hybrids of chaos dwarves and ogres, able to use Magic. Meanwhile, the Red Axe became the largest company of the Consortium, though still not large enough to outweigh the other seven. Hreidmar's plan required the destruction of rsrc5617' statue, a massive dwarven monument that stood at the city's entrance. Rising up from the bustling rsrc10748, the dwarves had long seen it as a symbol of their prosperity, for it had been King Alvis that (inadvertently) led them from the dark rsrc17440 to their rsrc17441. Keldagrim had only recently been opened to rsrc2859, and many dwarves did not trust them fully. Taking advantage of this, Hreidmar bribed a rsrc6549 to assist him in the destruction of the statue. The dwarf was instructed to ferry a human to the city from the mines - a common occurrence since the city's opening. When he neared the statue, the boatman pretended that there was something wrong with his boat. The boat crashed into the statue destroying it completely. The human (the player) was arrested by the rsrc11947, accused of destroying it. However, the Black Guard's rsrc10747 did not feel the player was responsible and, instead, asked that they help reconstruct the statue. The player accomplishes this over the course of the quest. When it is nearly finished, however, a debate arises amongst the Consortium as to whose head should be carved on it. Seizing the opportunity, Hreidmar argues that, as the most powerful company director, he should have his head put atop the statue. The player, though, interferes, and chooses another director instead. Enraged by the players' interference, Hreidmar boycotts the rsrc17442 and leaves the city, along with nearly every trace of rsrc9684. Over the course of the quest, the player discovers his intentions to claim rsrc672 in the name of rsrc1220. Hreidmar, in addition to destroying the statue, was already taking a number of actions to prepare for war. Secretly, he had allied himself with the gnomes of rsrc10745. Together, they had begun manufacturing an army of rsrc16898. Additionally, Hreidmar had obtained the aid of rsrc10743, an infamous dwarven warrior released from the Black Guard for his brutality. Hreidmar had also gained the support of an rsrc2500 that was found nearly dead on rsrc4558. Using the shaman's magical abilities, he had erased the memories of those that discovered his plot. Before the end of the quest, the player's memory is erased, leaving him or her unaware of The Red Axe's plans. "

Despite Keldagrim being an underground city, Rind manages to grow strange insect-eating plants in the garden, as well as a strange species of subterranean mushrooms. He also knows how to grow the elusive rsrc7345, although their seeds' rarity has made doing so impossible. Because the garden was neglected so much during the city's recent years, the garden has become very sparse. Rind seeks to fix this, although it has proven difficult. Rind is also quite knowledgeable in the city's history. His knowledge spans back even to the city's creation, which occurred during the rsrc1224. He also knows about the city's different ages, such as the Age of Kings and the Golden Age, and is willing to share his findings with adventurers. He also seems to know about the creation of the Consortium, but his vast amount of work usually prevents him from explaining much. Rind also plays a small role in the rsrc16244, during which he gives the player a letter which they may deliver to the gardener at the rsrc352 patch south of rsrc437, rsrc5243, for a small reward. This letter mentions the Annual Asgarnia Gardening Conference. In that letter to Elstan, it is revealed Rind tried out Elstan's method in cross-pollinating certain plants after learning about it from Elstan's presentation at the Annual Asgarnia Gardening Conference. After trying certain combinations in cross-pollinating, Rind found out that it lead to triple herbicide resistance in rsrc4049.

Even if he is able to obtain gems from Shilo village for outrageously low prices, the gout tuber would still be much cheaper to him than to a non-native. It could be possible that the natives of Karamja have better knowledge of where to find gout tubers or how to cultivate them."

Savant's location is hidden, and she cannot be found in rsrc15920, though the player communicates with her through the Temple Knight rsrc4804, which is given to the player by rsrc1778, the lead recruiter of the Temple Knights. When players ask her about herself, she would talk a bit about the Temple Knights' magical research team and herself. She has a grudge against the rsrc2224, where she was denied entry because they thought she was \"just a girl\" and that she would be \"too scared\" to research effectively. "

    "article-text": "The Sawmill operator can be found along the southern wall of the rsrc378 rsrc6188 on members servers, at the rsrc17478 rsrc8659 on the rsrc8743. He can turn four kinds of logs into planks (see rsrc7667), and also runs a rsrc17479 shop selling rsrc2158, three kinds of rsrc2416, and rsrc5008. He will not accept rsrc17480 logs, except indirectly through house rsrc4389. Members can obtain planks by taking logs to the sawmill operator. Right-click on this rsrc6277, and there will be a \"Buy planks\" option. Players can then choose to make regular rsrc2159 from regular logs, rsrc2473 from oak logs, rsrc1088 from teak logs, or rsrc292 from mahogany logs, for a price. The fastest way to make planks using the Sawmill involves the rsrc7666. The teleport will take the player directly to the sawmill. An amulet of glory or a ring of dueling can then be used to bank. The second fastest way to make planks using the Sawmill involves the rsrc1867. Start at rsrc430 and use the balloon to travel to the location northeast of rsrc378, which is close to the rsrc7667. One willow log is required to make this journey. The balloon has a weight restriction (under 40 kg), so some players may only be able to carry 19 oak logs per round; however, wearing rsrc17481 can allow the maximum of 26 oak logs to be brought. After making the planks, use a worn ring of dueling to teleport back to Castle Wars. Another way to do this is to fly from Castle Wars to the lumberyard and chop down the oak logs there. Once the planks are made, teleport back to Castle Wars. This eliminates the weight restrictions for balloon travel, though it is a bit longer than taking logs from your bank. It is possible to make over 1500 planks per hour using this method. The third fastest way to make planks using the Sawmill involves the Gnome Glider system. Use a rsrc3845 to teleport to the Duel Arena, run southwest and take the glider to the Grand Tree. From there, take the Glider (run north into and its up at the top of the Grand tree) to Lemanto-Andra, which is south-east of the Digsite in Varrock. Run north from there, until you reach the first gate on your left (marked by a red line on your minimap) to the Sawmill and make the planks. Then use a ring of dueling to teleport to Castle Wars to bank. The fourth fastest way to make planks using the Sawmill involves teleporting to Varrock. Run from Varrock to the Sawmill and make planks, then teleport to Varrock using the spell or a tablet, and run to east Varrock bank to bank. A variation on these methods that would add woodcutting experience and increase profit per plank at the expense of time would involve cutting oak logs from the Oak Trees west of the Balloon. rsrc17482 can take oak logs to the Sawmill to create oak planks. They take the Sawmill fee with them. One way to use this is to carry noted oak logs, then ask the Butler to unnote them, then ask for the unnoted logs to be taken to the Sawmill. The planks received can then be used to train construction immediately, or can be sent to the bank using the Butler for profit. Another variation is to go outside your house, cut oak logs, go inside your house, have the oaks sent to the sawmill, and use them to train construction."

Sigmund is a high-ranking member of rsrc16211, a former advisor to rsrc1460 and the main antagonist in the rsrc17517. He has been involved in three attempts to destroy the rsrc2165 rsrc873. The first was during the rsrc17518 rsrc15898, the second during the rsrc3232 quest, and again in the rsrc1269 quest. During this quest, the player is sent to recover silverware allegedly stolen by underground goblins. During this quest, it is discovered that Sigmund has taken the silverware and is a member of Humans Against Monsters, or rsrc16211. His attempts at creating a war between rsrc538 and the rsrc2165 were thwarted, and he was dismissed for treason by rsrc1460. During the rsrc3232 quest, it is revealed by a rsrc16211 member that Sigmund and rsrc12224, head of H.A.M, are 'planning something big'. After eavesdropping on the H.A.M council, it is discovered that they are using a machine they bought from the dwarves of rsrc672 for unknown purposes. Once the dead Dorgeshuun rsrc4945 has been revived, she reveals that the H.A.M are going to use the machine to flood the rsrc2165 capital, rsrc1271. After infiltrating the caves with the machine in it and slaying the H.A.M helpers, the player and Zanik battle the level 50 Sigmund. Using a rsrc4896, he escapes death and swears that they will meet again. The ring works even if you reduce his rsrc65 to 0. Sigmund is rather simple to defeat. First, players must defeat his cronies. Afterwards, both the player and rsrc4945 can focus on Sigmund alone. Sigmund, probably out of spite of Zanik, will use rsrc3014 rather than the rsrc16953 against whatever rsrc10737 you use, thus making him vulnerable. In this quest, Sigmund and his men ambush rsrc873 at the rsrc2369. After a brief struggle, he captures rsrc4945 and ties her to the new rail line linking rsrc672 and rsrc1271 in the hopes of starting war between the two cities. However, his plans are foiled by an adventurer who defeats him and manages to get Zanik off the track just before the train arrives. This time, Sigmund is slightly harder to defeat. rsrc4945 will not be able to help you, and his combat level has increased from level 50 to level 64 since the last encounter. He will activate protection prayers depending on which combat style the player attacks with. "

Prior to the burning of the rsrc2224, Sin'keth was a low-ranking member of the Dagon'hai. At the time, Zamorakians were grudgingly accepted in society, and so he was permitted safe entry into rsrc378 along with the rest of the Dagon'hai. Shortly before the burning of the Wizards' Tower in the Year 70, one of the Dagon'hai elders, rsrc9501, granted him the title of \"Hyeraph\"; a position only slightly below Elder. When the Wizards' Tower fell at the hands of Zamorakian mages, the backlash against Zamorakians was swift and deadly. Soon nearly all Zamorakians were forced from predominantly rsrc1222 settlements, and the Dagon'hai were made into top priority targets. The Dagon'hai, despite remaining undetected for some time, were eventually discovered by one of the Varrock rsrc3005. The Dagon'hai were engaged in combat with the city's soldiers, forced to retreat or die. The Dagon'hai suffered heavy casualties, including all three of the Elders: Dag'eth, rsrc9495, and rsrc9498. Sin'keth and the surviving Dagon'hai narrowly escaped into the forest northeast of the city, but were pursued by soldiers. They fled towards the rsrc464, eventually coming to a statue of Saradomin in which they had secretly created an escape tunnel. Sin'keth entered last, casting an rsrc857 spell at the entrance to cover their tracks. The confused guard mistook the escape as an omen, believing that Saradomin's statue had \"swallowed them\". Sin'keth, the highest ranking member of the Dagon'hai left, was accepted as the group's sole elder. In the coming years he would work to keep them hidden from the eye of Varrock, although the tale of Saradomin's statue defeating them grew until soon it was accepted that the Dagon'hai were dead. Sin'keth had one son, whom he named Surok. Following Sin'keth's death, Surok took control of the Dagon'hai, and is very active today."

Each map type also has a rsrc289 level requirement before it can be hung in the house; check the rsrc1096 page. Sir Renitee can paint rsrc15128 of people that a player has met. These portraits can be hung in the Quest Hall, and each portrait has an associated quest requirement: Sir Renitee's painting skills extend to landscapes, as well as people.

Sir Renitee refuses to provide this service to any player whose rsrc289 level (including any rsrc17526) is below 16, the level required for an rsrc17527. In a rsrc156, players can paint their crest on a rsrc6946 or rsrc475 or rsrc581, using the rsrc520's rsrc6948 or rsrc6947. A rsrc2163 may also be made with the player's crest, once the character is high enough level to build a rsrc2160. Note that painting your crest on helms or shields turns them into members-only items; banners are always members-only. Once painted, a helmet or shield cannot be repainted nor reversed to its original state. In the event of a PvP death, however, the shields and helmets will revert so the killer is able to retrieve them. For those who want variety, and have a lot of bank space, buying several sets of rune kites and full helms, along with Falador and House Teleport Tabs, is a fast way to accumulate every set. One of the easy tasks in the rsrc5633 is to find out what your family crest is from him, and one of the hard tasks is to change your family crest to the Saradomin symbol, which requires 70+ rsrc81. His name is a pun on the word \"serenity\". Sir Renitee appears to rock back and forth in his chair. Originally, players were able to retrieve their own painted helmets and kiteshields after dying to another player. This was deemed unfairly advantageous by the developers and promptly corrected."

Each Slayer Master requires a certain Slayer and rsrc173 in order to be assigned monsters. Players will also receive rsrc293 upon completing rsrc16024 after completing five tasks (except Turael). All slayer masters sell useful items. The store article is at rsrc5670. rsrc2944 gives the easiest tasks and is ideal for lower level players. They have no minimum combat or Slayer level requirements before players may receive assignments. He is located in a small house south of the rsrc956 in rsrc803. The quickest ways to reach them are to use: If a player of any level receives an assignment they do not wish to do, Turael may consider giving players an easier assignment if they talk to him. However, this only works if the assignment is something that he doesn't assign. For example, if Chaeldar assigns a player rsrc4719, then the Burthorpe slayer master cannot change their task, as he too assigns Desert Lizards. However, if the number given is far greater than Turael would normally give, it is possible to change your task. For example, if Duradel assigns 140+ rsrc16441, then Turael will change this, as he would not assign that many to kill. In this case, Turael will give a new assignment, which could be a new creature to slay or fewer of the same creature. Note that it is impossible for a player to get Turael to reassign a task that he gave out. Completion of a task assigned by Turael will not grant any slayer points, in fact, if it was a task replacing one from another master, it will reset all the tasks you did before. So, if you're on the 48th task and take a replacement one from Turael, all progress will be reset to 0. rsrc7599's tasks come with a risk: tasks assigned by her must be done within the rsrc464. She has no minimum combat or Slayer level requirements, and can be found by the jailhouse in rsrc259, north-east of the bank. Assignments from her have a separate task completion counter to standard assignments, so players will have to complete five of her slayer assignments to begin earning slayer reward points. Completion of a task assigned by Krystilia grants: rsrc8256 is the second easiest Slayer Master. The minimum combat level requirement to be assigned tasks from him is 20. Mazchna is located northeast of rsrc284. The fastest ways to reach him are to use: Completion of a task assigned by Mazchna grants: rsrc3738 is a mid-level Slayer Master. The minimum combat level requirement to be assigned tasks from Vannaka is 40. He is located in the rsrc3317, east of the rsrc464 gate. The fastest ways to reach him are to use: Completion of a task assigned by Vannaka grants: rsrc6317 is a hard Slayer Master. To be assigned monsters from her, you must have completed rsrc527 and have a minimum combat level of 70. She is located in rsrc3820. The fastest way to reach her is to use a rsrc16021 to go to Zanaris. Otherwise, one can reach her by entering the shed in the rsrc2524 whilst wielding a rsrc5558 or rsrc5561. Completion of a task assigned by Chaeldar grants: rsrc5775 is the second hardest Slayer Master. The minimum combat level requirement to be assigned tasks from Nieve is 85. After the events of rsrc554, rsrc10279 replaces Nieve as the slayer master. She is located in the rsrc1530, near the yew trees and the southern bank. The fastest way to reach her is to use: Completion of a task assigned by Nieve grants: rsrc7309 is the hardest Slayer Master. To be assigned tasks from Duradel, players must have a Slayer level of at least 50, and a combat level of at least 100. Also, to be able to enter rsrc3139, where Duradel resides, players must have completed the rsrc2355 quest. He is located on the platform bridging the river at the fishing shop in Shilo Village. Although Duradel is usually north of the river (or sometimes on the bridge), he cannot be accessed from north of the river. Instead, enter the fishing shop south of the river, climb the ladder there, and cross the bridge to get to him. The fastest ways to reach Shilo Village are to use: Completion of a task assigned by Duradel grants:  (XX) rsrc173"

This fits his profession as a spy. Saying an incorrect password to him will trigger dialogue where he and the player character say seemingly random phrases back and forth. One of these phrases is \"Oranges are not the only fruit\", the name of a novel written by Jeanette Winterson. He insists on calling the player \"Operative Budgie\".

Smokin' Joe plays a large role in the rsrc3329 rsrc15898. During the quest, players must help rid his home (which is actually little more than a small cave) of a rat-infestation. To do this, they must place rsrc4813 in a rsrc953 and light them on fire using a rsrc470. They also must use their rsrc1625 to help kill any escaping rats. Once this is done, Joe will tell them the location of the Keldagrim rsrc3330, as well as instruct his large cat, rsrc15757, to allow them safe entry. Due to age, Joe is not a particularly strong or active dwarf. He also suffers from very bad rsrc17541, a lung disease he got when he was younger because of his extensive use of a smoking pipe. The disease makes him hard to understand, as his speech is often punctuated with wheezing, grunting, and coughing. During Rat Catchers, he even coughs something up, and although it doesn't specify what it was, it is most likely a piece of his deteriorating lungs. However, during the quest it is implied that he may be exaggerating his condition to gain sympathy (and, as a result, favours) from others. When he goes for an entire conversation without his usual coughing and wheezing, the player points this out. Joe acts as though he has no idea what they are talking about. Joe also has a cat named The Beast, which guards the Rat Pits beneath the rsrc16708 pub. He has spent much of his life training cats to kill rsrc4222 in the Rat Pits, although it is an inhumane and potentially costly business. As a result, he is frowned upon by much of society. Despite this, he has ties with rat catchers in rsrc378, rsrc729, and rsrc405. After and during the quest, Smokin' Joe will explain how the Rat Pits work, as well as give players a manual with additional information about the Pits.

I am unconcerned with the plight of mankind and their petty wars and beliefs.\" This is likely because the Sphinx is the guardian of feline kind. rsrc4145 is not a friend of cats or Sphinxes. The Sphinx is involved in three quests:  The characteristics of the rsrc17546 are a blend of Egyptian and Greek mythology. In the legend of Oedipus the Sphinx would ask passers by riddles and if they answered incorrectly the Sphinx would strangle and consume them. In the rsrc3109's house, he has a golden statue of a sphinx on his bookcase. This may mean he too has spoken to the sphinx and received an rsrc9647 off of her. When the player asks him about his life, he will mention that he visited Sophanem and purchased the statue as a souvenir. After he is asked if he has spoken to the Sphinx, he replies that the Sphinx is simply a tall tale and does not exist, though the player will protest that it does. This can only happen after one has completed rsrc778. If the player speaks with rsrc16280 while wearing a rsrc4224, Bob will refer to the rsrc450 sphinxes. This implies that there are or were more than one sphinx. If you talk to the Sphinx after Icthlarin's Little Helper, with a cat with you, and select \"I need help with the devourer\", she will eventually say that she was impressed with your actions and says that she may have work for you at a later date, meaning that there may be another cat oriented quest. The Sphinx tells the player when asked about rsrc13497 that he once was worshipped by rsrc9686, but they left him for rsrc1220, although she then says it may have actually been Zaros but it was so long ago that it doesn't really matter."

If an incorrect overhead prayer is used when they attack, they will always deal 30 damage regardless of the player's defensive bonuses. rsrc4844 does not work against the attack. If the player uses the correct overhead prayer just before they attack, they will drain 30 prayer points instead. This can be taxing on players without 90+ prayer, as they will always be completely drained of prayer after the third spirit attacks. The prayer drain can be cut by half (to 15 points) by wielding a rsrc1581 when they attack. Once all three finish their attack, they return to the River of Souls, wailing quotes such as \"Join us.\", \"I obey.\", and \"Steal your soul.\" They will stay there and despawn after a short time unless they are called before they do so.

Any souls that have not attacked the player upon being called will despawn upon attempting to attack them."

He has been currently attempting to gain control of rsrc378, a plot that is exposed and thwarted during the rsrc1163 rsrc15898. Surok is an older wizard, although his power should not be underestimated, as he is capable of using very powerful magic and summoning fearsome and incredibly strong creatures. He has a rather short fuse and quickly gets angry at people. At times, he is overconfident of himself, and when his plans fail anyway, he wants vengeance, like the stereotypical villain. He is a loyal follower of rsrc1220. Surok Magis is quite possibly the successor of his father, rsrc9497, who led the rsrc5087 after the discovery of the rsrc9499 and exile from rsrc378. Surok eventually returned to the Tunnel of Chaos years later with his followers after almost all knowledge of their organisation had faded. He then turned his attention to the plan that had been foiled years earlier at the discovery of the tunnel which was to create a reincarnation of Zamorak's will. In 169 of the rsrc2390, Surok decided to avenge his father by committing a silent coup d'\u00e9tat and turn rsrc16679 into his puppet. He came to the rsrc5244 library where he met rsrc1161, the leader of the rsrc12212 (Surok was unaware of this fact at the time). Rat, aware of the danger Surok posed, had him guarded in the library, making him unable to make his move. He then sent an adventurer to give a rsrc7541, giving him a final warning. Surok read and destroyed the letter, outraged and told the adventurer it was of no importance. Surok claimed that he was working on a special ceremony but needed certain materials for it. He tricked the adventurer into delivering these materials for him. Surok gave the adventurer rsrc9494 and a rsrc1568 and sent them to infuse it with energy at the rsrc3310. After giving the rsrc7097 to Surok, the latter wrote a message for Rat and asked the adventurer to deliver it. A shocked Rat revealed to be a member of the Palace Guard, and that Surok was actually trying to take over rsrc538 in order to fulfil the will of his deceased father. The adventurer, switching sides upon realising their mistake, was sent to ask for help from rsrc2342, another member of the Palace Guard, who provided them with the rsrc2350 to take down Surok. As the adventurer approached Surok, who was now dressed in rsrc5087 apparel, using the infused wand, took control of rsrc4269's mind and ordered him to kill the adventurer. The adventurer duelled the possessed king and, when he was on the brink of death, they activated the beacon ring to teleport Zaff to the library. Zaff countered Surok's mind-control spell, disabling his magic and freeing the king from his control. Surok attempted to escape, but Zaff cast rsrc5205, imprisoning him in the library. "

Some items in his collection include the second eye of a mutant two-eyed rsrc372 and a hornless rsrc5462. He is certain his finds are one of a kind. However, it is possible that the items mentioned above were actually from a regular rsrc5464 and a regular horse respectively(a joke by Jagex referencing the non-existence of horses in RuneScape and the common desire from players for them).  Sylas may be a spin off from the famous fairytale of rsrc17561, hence the magical beans. The phrase \"Can't talk! Things to collect, magic beans to plant!\" may be a reference to the rabbit from rsrc17562."

I was honour-bound not to destroy the map piece, but I have used all my magical skill to keep it from being recovered. This map leads to the lair of the beast that destroyed my home, devoured my family, and burned to a cinder all that I love. But revenge would not benefit me now, and to disturb this beast is to risk bringing its wrath down upon another land. I cannot stop you from taking this map piece now, but think on this: if you can slay the Dragon of Crandor, you are a greater hero than my land ever produced. There is no shame in backing out now. "

The dungeon's power morphed Tolna into a three-headed abomination who is killed in the final part of the quest. All three heads must be defeated. They are rsrc296 and easy to defeat for their level. In addition, if a player poisons one head, then all the heads are poisoned. Each of the three heads, while having the same stats and defence bonuses, have varying attack styles and rsrc10707 that differ depending on whether the player is within melee distance of the heads. For example, the western head does not use melee attacks while the other two heads do.  Tolna's monster form has no chathead. Instead, his dialogue is spoken in the style of being told as a statement. Despite its attack appearing to be one of magic, it is a range attack rather than magic. This is similar to the belief that the rsrc6096 uses a magic attack when it is actually a ranged attack. Tolna are similar to the rsrc17581 in rsrc17582. However, they have no main body like the dead hand. Despite Tolna's western head never using melee attacks, casting rsrc7925 on it reveals that it has a slash attack that attacks every 6 ticks. Tolna's southern head has the slowest known rsrc10707 of any NPC, attacking every 12 seconds when the player is out of its melee attack distance."

    "article-text": "Trolls are one of the more unique, though not very intelligent, races of rsrc3096 who mainly inhabit the rsrc10562. Whilst the main population exists within the mountainous region known as rsrc946, the race is quite widespread, populations being known to stretch as far as rsrc2405, rsrc1611 and rsrc10564; populations of rsrc2496 are also known to exist near most popular rsrc2204. Trolls are typically named after whatever they first attempted to eat, so it is not uncommon for trolls to have strange names. Their weapons are rather crude, but are effective in combat. They often wield clubs, axes, and rocks for throwing, though a few may use other weapons, such as scimitars. They are something of an oddity when compared with other races such as rsrc2859 or rsrc172. Trolls are split into several different types, which all differ from each other greatly. It is not currently known if these are different species of troll or different breeds. These differences reflect the troll race's hardiness, and ability to adapt to a number of extreme environments, although all trolls share some similarities such as their rocky appearances, their thick skins, and their relatively low levels of intelligence, although there are some outliers such as rsrc11713, who is much more intelligent than a typical troll, and can speak grammatically correct English. Trolls which dwell in caves and rock-like faces, such as Death Plateau and the Troll Stronghold are known as mountain trolls. These are the most prosperous and numerous of the troll races. Important and notable trolls are generally from this breed and, though some mountain trolls are weaker than other breeds, they appear to be among the more resourceful, as they construct equipment from bone and granite, along with having a primitive society, such as guards, cooks and farmers. In addition to throwing rocks at anyone who would travel through their lands, these trolls devour humans and are known to put them in stews and eat them alive. While they like to eat humans, they will also eat goats if there are no humans to be found. Goutweed is a delicacy in mountain troll cuisine. The other mountain-dwelling trolls which live in the harsher and colder regions, such as on Trollweiss Mountain, are known as ice trolls. Ice trolls are some of the most vicious and powerful of the trolls, violently attacking various civilisations on different fronts, such as the Fremennik isles of Jatizso and Neitiznot. This tribe of ice trolls, it is worthy of note, have more of a leader-figure than mountain trolls or Trollweiss mountain ice trolls, called the Ice Troll King. Ice trolls usually use wooden clubs, bones, and large rocks to fight, though they wield them with great accuracy and power. Another group of ice trolls, led by rsrc11711, were driven out of rsrc672 and settled in rsrc10564. These trolls are much more unique compared to the other ice trolls as they have a much larger and intimidating build. They also have a greater hatred of humans, as a young rsrc3109 assisted the dwarves of Keldagrim in driving them out. However, this hatred seems to have dissipated once Mother's daughter, rsrc11705, takes over. The ice trolls of Weiss also take advantage of the various rsrc17596 beneath their city, using it to create rsrc17597 that provide various effects. According to the rsrc7048 during rsrc1336, when angry or upset, ice trolls are able to freeze the air around them. Whether this is a trait unique to the Trollweiss ice trolls or ice trolls overall is unknown. Another lesser-known race of trolls, an aquatic species which dispersed all over Gielinor, are the rsrc2496, which were a discontinued random event, popping up in various fishing spots all over the rivers and seas on the coasts of Gielinor. They held large bones and attacked with melee, often dropping different types of raw fish. They can now be found in the rsrc4646. Perhaps the most powerful and alarming species of troll is the elusive rsrc2488. Sea trolls are as vicious and nasty as their icy brethren, but they are far more organised and less primitive than any of the others. The majority of sea trolls wear and wield very little, only wooden clubs and odd armour fashioned from shells and old ship parts, mostly barrels, an act only repeated by the troll generals of the Mountain Troll Stronghold. Sea trolls are only found at the Piscatoris Fishing Colony, but it is assumed they dwell all over the waters and islands of the Northern Sea. Like the ice trolls, sea trolls have a leader of sorts, though it resembles more of an deep sea creature. "

During the quest, when you refer to Bob as Unferth's pet cat, he claims that you are wrong and that actually Unferth is Bob's pet human. Furthermore, Neite says that humans commonly mistake cats for their pets, when it is normally the other way around: humans are the pets of the cats. However, since humans without a Catspeak amulet can't understand cats, they prefer to let the humans think they are the owners so they protect the cats and do them favours (carrying them in their arms, for example, so they don't have to walk sometimes). The rsrc914 claims to have visited Unferth to examine his symptoms more times than his mother has had her hair fall out.

    "article-text": "Uri Molotov is the man who delivers the next part of a rsrc15912 when the player has completed an rsrc17222. To summon him the player needs to perform a specified emote in the proper location while wearing (or sometimes not wearing) a specified attire. The player must talk to him while still wearing the required attire upon which he will reward them with another clue scroll or rsrc2284 and utter a seemingly nonsensical phrase. This phrase has no bearing on the treasure trail. On hard and master trails, a rsrc4606 who looks identical to Uri will appear first and must be killed before Uri will appear. The emote equipment is not required when fighting the agent but will be required to speak to Uri once he appears. It will be required to summon him again, however. If the player does not follow Uri's directions or is not doing a Treasure Trail, Uri will only say \"I do not believe we have any business, Comrade.\"; however, he will say one of various phrases when giving out the next part of the trail, and the player will always reply with \"What?\".  His demeanor parodies the archetypal rsrc17609 agents, who would have been Russian, and, like other Soviets, would have referred to each other as \"comrade\". During Hard clue scroll emotes, if you use the equipment that you needed to get Uri and kill the Double Agent using the given equipment, upon the double agent's death Uri will spawn immediately, bypassing the emote requirement to call him again. His examine, \"shaken, not stirred,\" is a reference to rsrc17176. His quote beginning with \"once I was a poor man\" is a reference to the extremely high price of party hats in rsrc16012. The quote \"I am the egg man, are you one of the egg men?\" is a reference to rsrc17610 song I am the Walrus. The quote concerning being green is a reference to the similar quote by rsrc17611: \"It's not easy being green\". The quote about the jade monkey may is a reference to Mr. Burns' quote from rsrc17421. The quote \"Brother, do you even lift?\" is a reference to a rsrc17612. The quote \"Do you want ants? Because that's how you get ants.\" is a reference to the television series rsrc17613. The quote \"I once named a duck after a girl. Big mistake, they all hated it.\" is an allusion to the controversy surrounding the addition of rsrc6281, a duck in rsrc4193 which was named after a RuneScape streamer, and the subsequent negative response received by Mod Reach for implementing the update, which was widely seen as a case of favouritism. The quote \"I'm looking for a girl named Molly.\" is a reference to the music video Molly by rsrc17614. The quote \"Want to see me bend a spoon?\" is a reference to Israeli illusionist rsrc17615. The quote about Deziree is a reference to a rsrc17616 episode. The quote \"This is the last night you'll spend alone.\" is a line from The Last Night sung by the band rsrc17617. The breathing quote is a reference to a rsrc17618. The marriage quote is in reference to a song, Marry the Night by rsrc17619. The \"tonight we dine\" quote is a reference to the film rsrc17620. The quote \"Some say...\" is a reference to Jeremy Clarkson's introduction of The Stig from BBC's rsrc17621. The quote \"Connection lost. Please wait - attempting to reestablish\" is a reference to Runescape itself, when a player loses connection temporarily as Uri's chathead freezes completely upon saying this line. The quote relating to rsrc377 is a Portal reference, the original being \"the cake is a lie\". The quote \"I don't like pineapple, it has that bone in it\" is a reference to the 1936 song \"I like bananas, because they have no bones\" by George Elrick. The quote \"my magic carpet is full of eels\" is a reference to a rsrc16225 sketch about a poorly translated English-Hungarian phrasebook."

According to the rsrc17624, his rsrc64 level is 128. During the tutorial, he dismisses the player character's attempts at making idle conversation, and proceeds to teach them how rsrc507 and rsrc78 rsrc712 work. He tasks the player with rsrc17625 a rsrc4850 in close combat. Afterwards, he instructs the player to kill a second rat from outside of the enclosure using rsrc78 attacks, a strategy colloquially known as rsrc17626. Vannaka gives the player a rsrc3622, a rsrc10090, a rsrc71, and some rsrc16350 to keep as part of his lessons on the island. When encountered after the tutorial, Vannaka acts as a mid-level Slayer master. He is found due east of the rsrc464 entrance within the Edgeville Dungeon, and is marked by a slayer master icon on the rsrc8743. Players with rsrc173 40 or higher may receive rsrc3482 from him.

He is the starting point for the rsrc1503 quest, where he requests the player to help his client in gathering knowledge on the five houses of Great Kourend.

During rsrc230, players ask him about rsrc920, to which he suggests that players visit the rsrc11785 for more information. He was released silently along with the rsrc490, located in a dock south of rsrc4557 and north-west of rsrc2098.

During the rsrc1470 he was relocated to his current location, but did not allow players to board his ship, as it was unable to set sail just yet due to it requiring repairs.

She is the final boss of the rsrc1573, and currently the strongest monster in RuneScape. Verzik Vitur was the head of the Vitur family on her homeworld of rsrc1571, and arrived in rsrc3096 alongside many other rsrc2317 during the rsrc10219 by rsrc1210, who the vampyres refer to as the \"Stranger from Afar\". Before her departure, she had domesticated a large number of rsrc12901, which she brought with her to Gielinor. It is known that she aided rsrc16630 in conquering rsrc2264 during the rsrc1760, in which she was given rsrc13637's castle for her aid. This castle would become known as rsrc5555. She greatly enjoys blood sports, often demanding entertainment on the spot from her army of vampyres. Eventually, it became tiresome, so she instructed a construction of the rsrc1573, in which the most fearsome creatures would be placed for challengers to fight them. She also created an extensive breeding program for her nylocas, which resulted in three new types of Nylocas. One of these Nylocas bit her, which granted her new abilities but also made her obese and vulnerable to non-silver weaponry. Verzik makes a small appearance in rsrc2982, where she gives rsrc4199 and rsrc3009 an rsrc12995 to help them hunt down rsrc8980. To initiate the fight, a player must first talk to Verzik Vitur. She will have 3 phases:  \"V\u00e9rzik\" directly translates to \"bleeding\" in Hungarian."

Vitruvius is best known for creating the Elemental Workshop, as well as the creation of the Elemental, the Mind Elemental, Body Elemental, Cosmic Elemental and Chaos Elemental equipment. Despite his well-documented life, Vitruvius is an often-forgotten historian, though he is probably one of the greatest Metallurgists in Gielinor's history. Many of his experiments did go wrong, however; and according to legend, one of Vitruvius's apprentices, whose name is not recorded (in one of Vitruvius' books he was referred to as simply as \"Idiot\"), was killed during an accident while experimenting with primed elemental bars, and, later on in his studies, Vitruvius attempted to reanimate his dead assistant with the use of Body Magic. Though he was unsuccessful in that attempt he succeeded in the reanimation by transferring the mind into a body of Cosmic metal. Vitruvius later experimented with Chaos magic and created Chaos elemental metal with his assistant and an automaton he had built, named Da-vi. In real life, Vitruvius was a well known Roman engineer who wrote De Architectura (\"About Architecture\"), which is exactly what it says on the tin: a book detailing all kinds of Roman engineering practices. The book states that Vitruvius designed Da-vi based on a drawing made by an \"old artist friend\" of his, and then named it after them. The 'artist friend' he refers to is likely Da Vinci, who is the RuneScape counterpart of the real life artist and inventor Leonardo da Vinci. The drawing likely refers to the Vitruvian Man, which was drawn based on the writings of the real-life Vitruvius."

Lastly, he can also assign rsrc15090 on rsrc16657 worlds and give small rewards in return if the player asks him, \"Is there anything I can do for you?\" During the rsrc11205 event, players could utilise the rsrc14264 skill and visit an eastern island that may be inhabited by the Wise Old Man. He could be seen wearing beachwear instead of his usual robes. He also attended the rsrc2606, where he could be seen with several other iconic Old School RuneScape NPCs. Players can purchase the rsrc6000 and the rsrc8787 from him for 99,000 rsrc321, once they have completed all rsrc15898 in the game, which is a total of 266 rsrc8788. A reason why he sells the rsrc15966 can reflect on how the flashbacks of his adventures that he shows to the player are very similar to cutscenes that the player has encountered before, but with the quest's respective rsrc15930. In his youth, Dionysius (then called the Wise Young Man) was a hero who roamed RuneScape to help those in need. One of these heroic feats was assisting the rsrc672 rsrc2875 in driving out a group of rouge ice trolls led by rsrc11711 who attempted to storm the city. Mother's group would eventually settle in rsrc10564, vowing revenge on their sworn enemy. Some of his travels in his youth included the rsrc5287, where he fought the rsrc2464, rsrc450, where he vaporized a rsrc3570 with rsrc877, battling rsrc2509 in the arena, killing an rsrc2500 and battling rsrc9350. As he grew older, Dionysius began to feel bitter that he had not been \"adequately\" rewarded. By this time, he had taken residence in a small house in rsrc340. His most notorious act was the rsrc11219, killing several people in the process. One can watch the robbery's recording by speaking to the guard outside the bank - free for the first view, and a fee of 50 coins afterwards. One of these unfortunate victims, an NPC named Elfinlocks, dropped a blue partyhat, which the Wise Old Man claimed for himself due to its rarity and visual appeal. He plays a small role in rsrc10644 from the rsrc3781, where he provides the player with a rsrc3351 to help them locate the rsrc3782. The adventurer, tasked by rsrc11052 to grow a garden for her rsrc4269, was unsure of where to start as she demanded that the seeds be gathered through persuasion. They visited Dionysius, who was surprised that she had sent them on an errand and gave them a short story about her past. Upon learning that they possessed rsrc2521' ring, he told them about Charos' powers. He agreed to reactivate the ring, but only if they could prove that they had a knack for diplomacy. Once the adventurer passed his test, he enchanted the ring and sent them off. rsrc13410 would encounter an adventurer, who helped them repel a sea troll raid just as they were conversing. Unsure that they could handle the threat alone, he tasked them with bringing Dionysius to the rsrc2405. The adventurer visited Dionysius and he was surprised that people still remembered his good deeds, deciding that it would be his final adventure. Upon arriving and repelling the trolls, Dionysius tasked the adventurer with finding an army after the colony's leader, rsrc6275, sent most of the colonists away for their own safety. He told them to seek out rsrc11337 and to use his zombies, but Frumscone was unable to fulfill the request because everyone would keep asking him for zombies if he helped them. Frumscone told the adventurer to look for rsrc3270, who made them the army that the Colony needed. With the army ready, Dionysius and the adventurer battled the sea trolls. A rsrc12247 soon appeared, who Dionysius disposed of easily. However, a rsrc12244 then attacked him, dealing 254 damage but did not lower his health in the slightest. Despite the \"weak\" hit, Dionysius claimed to be too wounded and the adventurer was forced to battle the Sea Troll Queen alone, eventually killing it. He teleports back to his house afterwards, with the adventurer disappointed that they did not get his partyhat. Dionysius would later be recruited by rsrc13212 after learning of a new draconic threat by the rsrc1234 rsrc1237 and his creation rsrc6010. Dionysius would participate in the battle, fighting alongside rsrc5490 against a rsrc605, which the adventurer assisted in killing. Along with the other heros, Dionysius would assist the adventurer in taking out a rsrc1285, rsrc607 and rsrc4296. He and the others would later protect them from two rsrc622. When the adventurer slew Galvek, he congratulated them for their heroic feat. Dionysius makes a small appearance in rsrc8789, where rsrc11713 tells the adventurer why the trolls of Weiss hate him. The adventurer recruits him to create a ploy to trick Mother into allowing rsrc6599 to marry rsrc11705. He initially declines as he is not a family mediator, but accepts when the adventurer reminds him that they owe him one for saving him from the Sea Troll Queen. He tells them to create a coffin and a rsrc14591, which he drinks and is soon placed in the coffin. My Arm presents him to Mother, who is suspicious because the two lack battle wounds. The ploy fails when Dionysius starts snoring, then passes gas, enraging Mother and sends him, the adventurer, My Arm, Snowflake and Odd Mushroom into jail. Odd Mushroom dies from his wounds. Dionysius assists the adventurer against rsrc11697 and rsrc11711, partying with them after Mother is killed by the adventurer. Wise Old Man is the solution to the hard rsrc4568: Slide Woman. His challenge answer is 28. Note that if the rsrc913 quest is in progress, the Wise Old Man will not be able to help with a rsrc15903 until the quest is completed. The Wise Old Man can assign various tasks on rsrc16657 worlds and give small rewards in return. The tasks assigned fall into three categories. The most common tasks are to fetch between 3 and 15 of one of the following items (this list may not be exhaustive). They can be brought in more than one load. The Wise Old Man will not accept rsrc1021, asking what use they would be to him. Some tasks require the player to deliver a rsrc17647 to one of the following NPCs. In these cases the recipient will reward the player, rather than the Wise Old Man. The player can read the letter before delivering it. Finally, the Wise Old Man will occasionally ask the player to investigate the rsrc17648 under his bed; the player must then defeat it in rsrc712. Upon completing an item or delivery task, the player will receive a random reward from the following list: Upon completing the task of fighting the rsrc17648, the player will receive rsrc65 experience.  The Wise Old Man contacts the player upon purchasing a rsrc312, congratulating them on their achievement. If you choose the option \"three gods?\" after you complete Curse of the Empty Lord and Desert Treasure, the Old Man will get angry with you. He asks for \"arrowheads\", rather than the synonymous rsrc1757, which is what they are called in RuneScape. He refers to rsrc3622 as \"bronze shortswords\". This is what they were called before an update and also in RuneScape Classic. It was commonly believed that a rsrc3108 would be the final reward from the seemingly never-ending tasks, as the tasks got longer. As stated above, the Wise Old Man will not accept rsrc1021, asking what use they would be to him. This is likely connected to the security footage, in which the Wise Old Man breaks into the rsrc16143 Bank. He gives rsrc884 as a reward, despite claiming to be low on runes."

Zaff is secretly a member of the rsrc12212 (likely accounting for his shop's proximity to it), known to rsrc1161, and it appears his proficiency at magic is far higher than many would presume, as it was he who possessed the Beacon and used a spell to counter rsrc7098 mind control spell, disabling Surok's teleportation magic and imprisoning him in the library. Zaff sells noted rsrc815 for 7,000 coins each, in the barrel found in the corner of his shop. Depending on the tier of rsrc2343 completed, players will be able to buy battlestaves from his barrel daily. The battlestaves restock daily at 00:00 GMT. The battlestaves are claimed to be discounted, however they cost the same as the normal store price. The only possible \"discount\" is that their price does not increase as stock decreases, saving the player at most a few thousand gold per day. Partial completion of the quest rsrc1163 is required to purchase battlestaves, an update introduced into the game to combat bots. Completing a harder diary after claiming battlestaves for the day will NOT reset the stock. For example: completing the Easy diary and claiming 15 battlestaves, then completing the Medium diary and attempting to claim battlestaves again will tell you to come back tomorrow. Therefore it is recommended to claim your battlestaves after completing any diaries you plan to do today. "

Zanik is tasked to be the first cave goblin to visit rsrc806 as well as defend the Dorgeshuun city from a rsrc530 plot. She nearly loses her life while infiltrating the rsrc3673, but the player later revives her with the rsrc10615. After you finish the quest, she can be found in the underground rsrc873 city, rsrc1271. In rsrc1269, Zanik accompanies the player again. She meets the tribe of rsrc2369 and is later captured by rsrc7365, tied to a railway track. She is nearly run over, but the player saves her in time.  \"Zanik\" is similar to Polish \"Zanik\u0142\", which means \"[he] had disappeared\" or \"[he] had vanished\". If you talk to the cook while you are taking Zanik on tour of Lumbridge he will say it's Duke's birthday, like on the start of rsrc17661 quest. Zanik has her own theme song, but it is unlisted in Old School RuneScape. It was extended from around 1 minute long to almost 3 minutes long and made into a listed song in the main game on November 12, 2007. Both quests that she stars in lists her rsrc173 as 41."

Before the events of rsrc180 quest, he had a wizard apprentice called Clarence. Clarence hadn't been seen lately, but Zavistic didn't particularly worry about that until the fateful day that rsrc181 found a severed rsrc2424. Bert was understandably frightened about finding a loose appendage in his sand pit, and he asked the player to investigate the matter and see how it got there. After showing the rsrc2424 to the rsrc2423 and Zavistic, the stunned wizard realises that in fact the hand belongs to his student Clarence. Later, the mystery leads deeper as the player finds out that Bert had recently been working longer hours for rsrc3402, owner of Sandy Sand Co. for no extra pay. This is revealed upon comparing the work rotas that were rsrc2467 rsrc9192. Not only that, but when the player returned to Bert to ask him about the rotas, it was revealed that Clarence had something to do with Bert, who had recently found a strange scroll in his house. According to Zavistic, the scroll was a mind altering spell scroll. After Zavistic reviewed all the evidence, he asked the player to interrogate Sandy by means of a rsrc3400 (which is concocted with the help of rsrc3401) mixed in his coffee and a rsrc7749 that will record the interrogation. In the end, it was revealed that Sandy had paid Clarence to cast a mind-altering spell on Bert so he wouldn't realise he was working extra hours for the same pay. Sandy then killed Clarence so he wouldn't have to pay him for casting the spell. To further hide the evidence, he dismembered Clarence's dead body, which he sent hidden in sand to the various rsrc3847 all around Gielinor. Clarence's rsrc2424 ended up in rsrc181 sandpit in Yanille, and his rsrc10347 ended up in rsrc14148 sandpit in Entrana.  When he is summoned by a player via the bell outside the rsrc2334, the Zavistic Rarve that appears before the player is a duplicate of Zavistic, the original still clearly visible inside the tower."
