    "article-text": "A Doubt is a monster that can be fought during the rsrc1829 quest. Numerous Doubts are summoned during the first battle by rsrc5575, and represent the protagonist of the quest, rsrc5078, and his little nagging doubts about combat. Though they can be fought and killed with ease, it is recommended that players do not attempt to kill them and instead focus only on the main fight. All spawned Doubts will disappear once The Inadequacy is killed. Players can, however, take advantage of the Doubts by using rsrc10496 on them to heal hitpoints. Players should remember to turn rsrc17667 off whilst fighting The Inadequacy. Otherwise, players may start fighting the Doubts that are also attacking them. The Inadequacy has a higher max hit making a Doubt undesirable to attack. It's best to leave a Doubt seeing as they're highly inaccurate and do not hit very high. "

    "article-text": "Aberrant spectres are rsrc6905 that require level 60 rsrc285 to kill. They frequently drop large amounts of rsrc16793 and rsrc12201. Because of this, bringing a rsrc6952 and rsrc9297 when killing them is recommended. rsrc707, found in the rsrc1323, can be killed in their place if you are assigned aberrant spectres. A rsrc8275 or rsrc282 is required when fighting aberrant spectres; if you do not, their attacks will always hit and drain your combat stats extremely quickly. They attack using rsrc59, so the rsrc5495 prayer can be helpful, or players can wear rsrc3050. Using a rsrc1086 or rsrc271 will give you a large advantage, since they are an rsrc277 monster. However, bonuses do not stack with a rsrc17449/rsrc1710. It should also be noted that using Protect from Magic does not counter their stat-reducing abilities. Note: It is possible to use a rsrc984 inside the rsrc6117. This is recommended for fastest Slayer experience. It is also possible to rsrc16455 one of the aberrant spectres by using the south-eastern corner of the wall of the staircase-room, but only with a rsrc17668. This only works with rsrc78 or Magic, as there has to be at least six spaces between the player and the aberrant spectre before the player gets out of the spectre's attack range. It's not possible to use rsrc498 or thrown weapons such as rsrc16507 and rsrc665 without getting hit as their attack range is not long enough. It's possible to safe-spot in the rsrc2865 by standing on the brick pile just west of the rsrc505 chain shortcut and pulling spectres just in front of the suit of armour from the room south of the shortcut. A rsrc3167's rsrc16433 attack style will be able to target aberrant spectres from this distance, making it a very useful spot. Up to three herbs are dropped when the herb table is rolled. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has a 5/128 chance to access the rsrc16088.  "

Along with rsrc656, they are some of the highest levelled rsrc6905 that can be killed off task for a reasonable amount of profit, due to their rare drops and a reasonable drop rate on rsrc290. They are the only creatures in the game to drop the much coveted rsrc252. Like their rsrc242, the demons can also drop the rsrc268, although very rarely. In combat, abyssal demons are capable of teleporting either themselves or the player around, meaning that rsrc17626 is not possible. When you are teleported, you will stop attacking the demon, so make sure rsrc10524 is active so when the demon attacks you, you will continue to fight back. They also have relatively high accuracy, so bringing a full set of rsrc17673 is recommended to prolong trips. Being a demon, this creature is affected by the powers of rsrc2789, rsrc1321, and rsrc1324. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the standard rsrc550.  Abyssal demons did not drop the rsrc268 until the patch note updates on 30 June rsrc69. The iconic weapon dropped by the abyssal demon, the rsrc252, is the spine of the creature."

Abyssal guardians can hit fairly high for their level with rsrc507, though they have low rsrc30 and are fairly inaccurate. Abyssal guardians initiate attack with melee, but use rsrc59 if attacked first or the player is attacking them from a distance. Their magic attacks are stronger than their melee attacks, but less accurate. However, as they have a very fast reaction time while aggressive, players usually see the magic attack only after they become un-aggressive.  Abyssal guardians' heads have different sides, each representing a happy, angry, sad, and dead face. When it is idling, its happy face is at the front; when it is attacking, it will turn its angry face to the front; when it is being attacked, it will turn its sad face to the front; and when its health is reduced to zero, it will turn its dead face to the front before it dies."

    "article-text": "The Abyssal Sire is an rsrc272 boss that requires level 85 rsrc285 to kill, in addition to having assigned abyssal demons (or the Sire itself) by a rsrc1956. Although it resides in a multi-combat area, it is a solo-only boss. According to rsrc254, the Abyssal Sires are the engineers of the Abyss from a time before the God Wars. As their resources began to deplete and they had no means to escape, they constructed the Nexus and remained there in deep stasis. The Sire is located in the rsrc270, south of the rsrc257 used for rsrc866. It can be safely entered via the rsrc4594 code DIP (if the player has access to them), or it can be accessed via the Abyss although this drains the player's rsrc81, if not wearing an rsrc261, and rsrc265 them. There are four chambers in the Nexus where Sire can be found, allowing multiple people to fight the Sire per world, similar to rsrc2681. rsrc3360 cannot occur in the Sire's chamber; any random events following the player will be automatically dismissed entering appropriate range. Players in invalid tiles when a Sire is dormant will result in teleportation to the center of the chamber. It is known for dropping the rsrc241, which is then used at the rsrc16411 behind rsrc254 to get a chance of obtaining an rsrc252, rsrc268, rsrc281, rsrc7240 and untradeable parts of the rsrc239 - the rsrc243, rsrc249, and rsrc248, as well as a very small chance at the rsrc10186. As with all demons, the Sire is susceptible to the effects of rsrc2789, rsrc1321 and rsrc1324. The fight consists of three phases: Players have a 5/139 chance of receiving an item from this table.rsrc274 Players have a 3/139 chance of receiving an item from this table.rsrc2761 The Abyssal Sire drops items from the rsrc550 in multiples of two.  The Sire received several updates due to player complaints: rsrc10498 used to have a 2/3 chance of instantly disorienting the Sirersrc9854, regardless of the type of spell used. This was changed in rsrc16025 on 7 April rsrc69 to the current set of 25, 50, 75 and 100% rates for shadow rush, burst, blitz, and barrage as it was possible to not disorient the Sire with barrage spells which could result in a net loss during the trip. Prior to rsrc16486 on 31 March rsrc69, there was no warning when teleporting away from Sire's chambers with the rsrc17676 teleports. As the Sire is able to drop runes for these teleports, subsequent kills can result in casting teleporting spells instead. rsrc1453 was the most likely teleport spell used, as its spell icon was next to that of rsrc2994, which made it likely to cause a misclick. Prior to rsrc17677 on 24 August rsrc125, the respiratory systems would not be affected by the bonus damage and accuracy from an imbued slayer helmet. rsrc10498 used to have a 2/3 chance of instantly disorienting the Sirersrc9854, regardless of the type of spell used.

The Sire has multiple examine options that can be seen throughout the fight (including its rsrc14255). It is one of the few monsters that does not have a defensive animation; rather, it loops its idle animation instead. On release, players who attacked the Sire when it was dormant would end up performing a second attack when it woke up. This was a glitch and was fixed with an rsrc17678 on 22 February 2018."

They are difficult to hunt as they seem to have a high defence, hitpoints, and strength, although they have low accuracy. It should also be noted that they are difficult to poison, although they are not immune to it. Abyssal Walkers killed in the Abyss yield much lower exp. These monsters are aggressive, but will stop being aggressive after a while as well as the rsrc908 and the rsrc905. If hunting Abyssal monsters for their Runecrafting Pouch drops, it is recommended to use magic against these. At relatively high defence and magic levels (70+) a player should have absolutely no trouble with them, even accounting for the aggressive monsters in the outer ring of the Abyss. Players will only get a pouch if they have all the smaller pouches, and if a player has them all, they will no longer get them as a drop, unless one was lost."

    "article-text": "Adamant dragons are rsrc17351 first encountered during rsrc230, in which the player must fight against one during rsrc1237's assault. After completion of the quest, they can be found in the western chamber of the rsrc5487. To get back to the laboratory underneath rsrc926, players can travel using the rowboat from the quest or, after completion, taking a rsrc4462 and using it on the strange machine north of the rune dragon room, adding a teleport straight to rsrc926 on it. Adamant dragons are the result of a side project of rsrc1237's after being inspired by another rsrc1234, rsrc17679, which involves infusing rsrc1694 eggs with various metals. While Forcae's metal dragons were created to find a solution to the dragonkin's infertility, Zorgoth had bred his metal dragons for his rsrc11781. Adamant dragons have multiple attacks, similar to rsrc1285 and rsrc4296. Along with standard rsrc1395 attacks, they have a standard rsrc507, rsrc78 and rsrc59 attack (which resembles rsrc850), as well as two unique attacks. The first attack is a rsrc296 projectile, which lands on the player's position and splits into two more projectiles around the original projectile in a 5x5 area. These projectiles can hit from 14-25, but can be reduced to 4-8 by being under the effect of any poison protection. Players can avoid the attack entirely by moving three squares away from their original position when the attack was launched. The second attack is a Ranged attack that hits through rsrc3014, and uses the Blood Forfeit effect from rsrc414, where the dragon sacrifices 10% of its current hitpoints to deal damage equal to 20% of the player's current hitpoints. Because of this effect, it is recommended to keep the player's hitpoints around 40-50 to minimise the damage dealt from this attack. Upon release, adamant dragons used the Armour Piercing effect from rsrc419, which would be halved if the player activated rsrc3014. This was changed to the current attack in rsrc17680 on 8 January. In addition, adamant dragons had a 1/5 chance of their dragon bones drop being replaced by rsrc3288. This was removed from their drop table in rsrc16122 on 25 January 2018 as part of a balancing change. When the special attack was changed from the diamond bolts effect to the ruby bolts effect on 8 January, the rsrc17681 given by rsrc1956 was not changed until rsrc16141 on 26 July. Previously, the tip was \"Adamant dragons can fire metal bolts right through your armour as though it weren't there. Watch out for their poison bombs too.\""

He is summoned and then destroyed using rsrc2789, which results in the blade transforming into rsrc1321 as a result of absorbing his blood. He reappears as rsrc10656 during the final battle of the rsrc484 quest. He can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete. Although he is a rsrc619, killing Agrith-Naar will not grant any Slayer experience in the rsrc238. Warning: This fight occurs in an instanced area. This means you cannot recover any unprotected items should you die. Consider bringing an emergency teleport. Agrith-Naar uses melee up close and rsrc17682 at a distance. He is able to detect rsrc7104 and will avoid using attacks the player is praying against. He is also capable of teleporting the player within melee distance of him should the latter attempt to run or attack from a distance. He can only be defeated with the use of rsrc2789. Only the last hit must be dealt using Silverlight; normal weapons and spells can be used to weaken him. However, using Silverlight for the entire fight is still a good choice due to its passive damage boost against demonic creatures. The player must remain in melee distance when finishing him off using Silverlight. If the requirements to finish him off are met, poison damage will also kill Agrith-Naar as if the last hit had been made using Silverlight."

He wears robes, which make him vulnerable to rsrc78 as well as rsrc507 attacks. Ahrim can easily damage the player with his magical attacks, as they are very accurate even on rsrc3050. Aside from this, Ahrim can also use rsrc3189, rsrc3185 and rsrc3184 on the player, lowering their rsrc28, rsrc64 and rsrc30 stats respectively. Ahrim's set effect is Blighted Aura, which gives him a 20% chance to lower the player's Strength stat by 5 for each rsrc813. It is recommended that the player uses rsrc5495 when fighting him due to his accuracy - although note that it will not protect against his stat reductions. Even if using the Protect from Magic prayer, his stat reduction spells can still work, plus his set effect can still activate because the attack still counts as a successful hit, so the use of dragonhide armour and bringing a rsrc16014 is recommended. Ahrim is commonly defeated with the use of a rsrc1695, rsrc407/rsrc1677 or rsrc794. Players with high melee stats may opt for the use of an rsrc252 or rsrc1709 instead. "

The warriors are fairly well known for their great low-level rsrc1646 drop rate. Level 25 rsrc1870 is required to pickpocket these warriors.

Each wizard uses a different attack style and can hit fairly high, requiring players to be prepared for a three-on-one fight. The wizards are much stronger than their combat levels suggest, as most of their combat levels are due to their offensive stat levels. Together, they are comparable in damage output to a rsrc467 main boss. The goal should be to kill them as quickly as possible. Especially if there are no obstacles to get two of three wizards stuck behind, super sets, bossing food such as rsrc4013 or rsrc2004, and food for rsrc4844 such as rsrc4845 and/or rsrc8566 are highly advisable. Ancient Wizards have low rsrc30, so rsrc507 or rsrc78 is advised. Magic is not advised as they are resistant due to their high Magic level. It is worth noting the melee-using wizard has a significantly higher maximum hit than the rest of the wizards, so activating rsrc1264 is highly recommended while under attack by this wizard. Armour such as rsrc3050 is recommended. If available, the player should make use of nearby obstacles to limit the number of wizards able to attack the player at once. The other wizards cannot be used to safespot the melee wizard, he will simply walk through them. It is advised to kill the wizards in this order: Melee (if he cannot be safespotted), Ranged, and finally Magic, using the equivalent protection rsrc81 matching the style of the target wizard each time. A form of rsrc1037 is recommended as the melee-using wizard is capable of poisoning the player. For Ancient Wizards fought in the rsrc464, bring items you are prepared to lose.  Interestingly, the poison inflicted by the melee-using Ancient Wizard who uses a poisoned rsrc278 starts at 8, which is more than a dragon dagger (p++) available to players, which starts at 6."

    "article-text": "Ancient Wyverns are rsrc6905 that require a rsrc285 level of 82 in order to be harmed. They reside in the rsrc1384 on rsrc1238 and are the strongest species of Wyvern in Old School RuneScape. Like other rsrc15905, they require an rsrc1387, rsrc1388, rsrc1394 or rsrc1383 to be equipped in order to be slain. In addition to being harder to fight, Ancient Wyverns share the ability with rsrc1396 to use an unblockable rsrc78 attack that resembles a lighter coloured rsrc831. This attack ignores rsrc7104 and hits around 10, though they can also miss. They also appear to use all rsrc507 attack types. When fighting them, the highest defensive rsrc4920 the player can access is best suited to use against them.   They appear to use all attack styles when using rsrc507, depending on the animation they use: rsrc17687 when they use their talons, rsrc17688 when they jab with their tail and rsrc17689 when they bite the target. Originally, ancient wyverns had a significantly worse drop table. After player feedback, it was improved in rsrc17690 the next day. Upon release, the wyvern's rsrc30 level was 220. This was reduced to 150 in rsrc17691 on 18 January rsrc231. This also changed its rsrc173 from 227 to 210. Upon release, Ancient Wyverns only dropped a maximum of 12 seaweed spores. This was increased to 24 in rsrc16554 on 12 July rsrc231."

They first appear as non-attackable Ancient Fungi, which players must pick in order to provoke them out of the ground. Players who have been given a mutated zygomite rsrc3482 can choose to kill them as an alternative for the task. Ancient Zygomites use both rsrc9243 attacks and rsrc10718. Armour with a low magic defence bonus such as rsrc16144 will typically have a higher chance of being hit, therefore rsrc3050 is strongly recommended while fighting them, as its higher magic defence will reduce the chance of being damaged. If praying against their attacks, rsrc3014 is recommended, as their ranged attacks are stronger and more accurate than their melee attacks. Estimated drop rates are based off 1,000 kills.rsrc274 "

To summon one, players must use a rsrc604, rsrc618 and a rsrc473 on the Magical Animator. Defeating this armour is one of the fastest methods of obtaining rsrc1847. If you are a high level, farming the rsrc13023 might be a faster option. Since the Animated Adamant Armour is the second most powerful version, it's a good idea for lower levelled players to bring plenty of food, and slash resistant armour. The player will retain all of their rsrc17700 pieces when it is defeated; however, any armour below rsrc13022 has a chance to lose parts. You cannot use magic or ranged to kill the armour, as both will always hit zero. When you place the armour on the Magical Animator this text appears over your chatbox: You place your armour on the platform where it disappears.... The animator hums, something appears to be working. You stand back... Players are advised to use a strong weapon with the Crush style attack, such as the rsrc5414 or the rsrc247 on crush, as the Animated Adamant Armour is weak to Crush type attacks. Lower levelled players might opt for a rsrc4576 or rsrc5434. You could also safe-spot the Animated Adamant Armour by using a rsrc498, preferably a rsrc4995 imbued via the Nightmare Zone. However, you can use any type of halberd as long as you have the required levels. After the armour spawns, run to the spot shown in the image to the left. The Animated Armour will be trapped next to the platform, allowing you to attack it without taking any damage. Non-crush weapons such as the rsrc252, rsrc90 or rsrc639 will work fine if your rsrc28 level is high enough (85 or higher is recommended), but they will not provide as fast a kill rate as crush-based attacks.  Even though players only used the three required pieces to create the animated armour, it wields an rsrc356. It is unknown where it got this from. The Animated adamant armour attacks at the same speed as a scimitar, despite wielding a 2h sword."

    "article-text": "Animated Steel Armour is a player-created foe, encountered at the rsrc50. To summon one, players must use a rsrc5090, rsrc8102 and a rsrc6946 on the Magical Animator. The Steel animated armour isn't commonly used for two reasons: pieces will occasionally be lost, and higher variants yield better rsrc1847 per hour. Despite being one of the weakest armour types, players should still bring a few pieces of food. If players do decide to fight the Steel armour for whatever reason, it is suggested to also carry a few extra armour parts to replace the ones that get destroyed. If possible, players should fight animated armour made of rsrc13022 or higher instead, due to the fact that they will not lose any parts. High level players are strongly advised to fight Rune or Adamant animations as they are the quickest method for earning tokens. When you place the armour on the Magical Animator this text appears: You place your armour on the platform where it disappears.... The animator hums, something appears to be working. You stand back... When you lose a piece of armour you receive this text: A piece of the armour crumbles to dust. The Animated Steel Armour is weak to crush attacks, like all the other variants. However, it is weak enough that you can easily use your preferred weapon without much resistance. The fact remains that exploiting a weakness will always yield better results, though. A rsrc5414 or the rsrc247 on crush style would be two of the best options, as they both have high crush accuracy and strength. If for some reason you need to safe-spot the Steel armour, you can do so with a rsrc498. After the armour spawns, run to the spot shown in the image to the left. The Animated Armour will be trapped next to the platform, allowing you to attack it without taking any damage. Note: you will occasionally lose armour pieces. "

They can be assigned as slayer tasks by rsrc3738, rsrc5775/rsrc10279, rsrc7599 and rsrc7309. Currently, the fastest way of doing this task is by using rsrc984 at western part of rsrc17702, although players should use caution using this method due to the hazards of both rsrc1008 and rsrc17703. There is a safe spot at rsrc4257, located behind the south west coffin, on the square between the bone spawns. This monsters drops seeds from the rsrc14052. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the rsrc16088.  "

    "article-text": "Armadylian guards appear when doing rsrc92 rsrc17705. They call out \"No warning! Begone!\" upon appearing. The guard will spawn upon digging at the correct coordinates, and must be defeated in order to advance in the treasure trail. Like the aviansies found in the rsrc467, the guard is flying too high to be attacked using melee, and must instead be defeated by means of rsrc78, rsrc59 or a rsrc2827. Since the guard only uses ranged attacks, rsrc3014 will circumvent all damage. After defeating the guard, the player must dig at the same spot again, and will be allowed to do so unhindered.   There is currently a glitch where the guard's death cry is heard twice. The second cry happens when the drop appears, as the drop seems to have a small delay."

All mountain trolls are named after the first thing they ate or tried to eat. Arrg, however, makes an exception. With some trolls, the name of what they first ate is unknown. This is the case with Arrg, so he was named after the sound made by the first thing he ate. This is the same case with rsrc12249 and rsrc10688. Arrg is the second strongest Mountain rsrc2504 in RuneScape, now being surpassed by rsrc12248 from the rsrc17706 quest. He uses rsrc507 and rsrc78, both of which can hit up to 38, although the rsrc17146 reduces the maximum damage from ranging to 20. Another way to kill him is to wear at least rune, have 6-8 doses of prayer potion pray protect from melee, and he will rarely hit you with his ranged and only around 4-8 monkfish are needed, if 70 or higher combat. He teleports the player to the rsrc13484 to fight. It is best to use a combination of rsrc1264 and rsrc3014 against him and switch prayers as he switches attacks. His attack speed is equivalent to that of a whip, so this can be tricky. Arrg can only be fought during the quest, and afterwards he can be fought in the rsrc238. This monsters drops seeds from the rsrc14052.  Unlike most trolls, Arrg drops regular rsrc2071 instead of rsrc2475."

Like other creatures within the dungeon, they can be found fighting for their god rsrc1664, engaging in combat against the followers of rsrc1220. The ability to be assigned aviantese can be purchased for 80 rsrc293. Once unlocked, they can be toggled off. Though, in order to toggle them back on, they must be purchased again for 80 slayer points or removed from the assignments list through the use of the cancellation slots. Unlike most other followers, however, Aviansies have an increased sense of danger. Even if they are in combat with another monster, if the player attempts to attack them, the Aviansie will start attacking the player immediately; this trait is shared by all Armadylian monsters. As they are airborne, they are completely immune to rsrc507 attacks except for Salamanders, and can only be damaged with either rsrc78 or rsrc59. If the player attempts to attack an Aviansie with a rsrc16414, the message The Aviansie is flying too high for you to attack using melee. will appear in their chatbox, and the Aviansie will become rsrc16139 and start attacking the player if it hasn't already. rsrc15901 drops from Aviansies in the God Wars Dungeon will be noted for players that have completed the hard rsrc684. However, adamant bar drops from Aviansies in the rsrc690 are noted regardless of diary completion. They also do not drop rsrc7620, unlike all other monsters in the rsrc464. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the rsrc16088.  Avian means \"of or relating to birds\". Aviansie come in both genders, female ones appear to have a blue head and a lower cut platebody and the males do not have helmets. As of 24 September 2015, adamant bar drops from Aviansies in the God Wars Dungeon are now noted for players that have completed the hard Fremennik Diary."

The Aviantese were believed to have become extinct during the rsrc1224, however, with the recent thawing of the previously frozen rsrc467 have revived many God Wars combatants, including the Aviantese. Their destruction was one of the factors contributing to Armadyl's inactivity in Gielinor. He has 3 bodyguards: The names comes from avis, which is Latin for \"bird\"."

Turn right and go immediately north and chop down the vines (requiring 34 rsrc66 to chop the vines). If you have at least 87 Agility, then run northwest until you reach a bright green vine, bringing you directly to baby green dragons. If you do not have 87 Agility, you may instead continue to run west into a room with a ring-shaped pond of lava. Go up the staircase in the north of this room.

These bandits will automatically attack any rsrc16059 that is wearing an item associated with rsrc1222 or rsrc1220, as bandits are descended from the followers of rsrc1210, who were hunted down by Saradomin and Zamorak. Many players use this mechanic as a way to efficiently train their rsrc712 skills. Players will wear a rsrc16271-affiliated rsrc15926, and then proceed to be attacked by the bandits. This allows players to easily and efficiently gain large amounts of Combat rsrc19, as the bandits will never stop attacking the player. These bandits can also be pickpocketed at level 53 rsrc1870. If a player wears a Saradomin item and approaches a bandit, they will shout \"Time to die, Saradominist filth!\" and become rsrc16139 towards that player. If a player wears a Zamorakian item, they will shout \"Prepare to suffer, Zamorakian scum!\" instead. If a player attacks other bandits, the bandits will exclaim \"You chose the wrong place to start trouble!\" and become rsrc16139 towards the player. Saradomin and Zamorak items are the only god-related items to have this effect on the bandits, because they do not have a grudge against the other gods of rsrc15920. AFK experience rates from bandits range from 30k to 70k xp per hour depending on levels. They are one of the most popular training spots for rsrc17. A rsrc4896 will reduce the risk of being killed if the wearer remains AFK for too long, or eliminate the risk entirely if the wearer is above level 70 in rsrc65. Bandits wield a dagger with a red handle that is unobtainable by players."

Blackjacking is the fastest Thieving experience from level 45 to 91 Thieving. In order to get the maximum experience rates, one must make it about 4/5 into the quest rsrc4897, which has a requirement of 30 Thieving and the ability to kill a level 70 bandit. However, this quest is easily completable using rsrc881 behind the camel pen to kill the bandit at the end of the quest.

Players must wear rsrc5669 while fighting them in order to avoid the effects of their screams, which causes the player to take 6 damage and have their stats greatly reduced in rsrc28, rsrc64, rsrc30, rsrc78, rsrc59, rsrc81 and rsrc505 with every attack received. There is a rsrc16428 to the north of the staircase leading to the 1st2nd floor[?], behind the standing torch, between the staircase and wall. As banshee's attacks are rsrc9243, it is advised to wear rsrc3054 in order to minimise damage taken while fighting them. As banshees qualify as undead, the effects of the rsrc1086 and the rsrc825 spell will work on them. Using a rsrc282 will eliminate the need to wear earmuffs, though its bonuses will not stack with the salve amulet. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the standard rsrc550. Banshees become translucent when moving or turning but become solid when standing still. Every time you land a hit on a banshee, no matter the number, it will regenerate 1 hitpoint."

It has two attacks: attacking you with its anchor if you are in melee range, and if it cannot reach you, it will perform an attack in which it will slam its anchor to the ground, triggering an earthquake that can inflict up to 25 damage. rsrc16483 is highly advised, but due to Barrelchest's attacks deactivating and draining prayers, it is recommended to use quick-prayers to reactivate prayers swiftly. Upon defeat, Barrelchest will drop the rsrc2133, but it requires repairs before it can be equipped. Due to its high offensive melee stats, it is recommended to wear armour that provides high melee defence, preferably against crushing attacks. Barrelchest also drains your defence. Lower level players are advised to use a rsrc17716, have a rsrc1044 on standby, and high healing foods. Fast melee weapons such as the rsrc278's special attack and the rsrc252 are effective. Barrelchest can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete. "

Like rsrc4734, players must equip a rsrc7952 when fighting these monsters. Players require a rsrc30 level of 20 in order to receive basilisks as a rsrc3482, as a Defence level of 20 is required to wield the shield. Basilisks have a below average accuracy for their level, but have high Defence. Without the mirror shield, the player's stats will be greatly reduced. rsrc1264 prayer can be used, but the stats will still be lowered. Basilisks are a good source of rsrc884. Due to their high drop rate of rsrc2768, it would be useful to bring a rsrc1339 or kill some rsrc17717 to the east, to use rsrc8 on their frequent metal armour and weapon drops. These can be rsrc16428 from the southern entrance to their area in the slayer cave, by using the south-east wall to stop their movement or by using the rocks on either side of the room. Note that players cannot set up a rsrc984 within the dungeon. "

They appear in the arena itself, and their primary function is to battle the player, thus allowing the player to cast their chosen rsrc1358 100 times on any of the mages in order to be able to use the spell outside of the Arena. Battle mages come in three types; rsrc1222 mages, who carry rsrc9221 and have an appearance similar to the rsrc10271 in rsrc725, rsrc1220 mages, who appear pale and cloaked, bearing similarities to rsrc2659 and carry rsrc10452, and rsrc2168 mages, who are rsrc172 and look akin to rsrc7523 who ride the backs of rsrc6736 in the rsrc8760. The maximum hit of the mages is quite high for their level, and the rsrc5495 prayer is recommended when battling them. However, for people with higher magic and rsrc30 (80+ and 70+ respectively recommended), it might be more economical to use rsrc184. Their rsrc10611 depends on the type of rsrc4208 a player wears; mages are not aggressive to players wearing their God's cape. Additionally, wielding a rsrc9127 whilst wearing a non-Guthix cape such as the Saradomin cape or Zamorak cape will cause only one type of Battle mage to be aggressive towards players at any one time. However, this is generally not a concern as it is not a rsrc1675."

Five Big Snakes spawn in a cave on rsrc4572. The pit they are in is a multicombat zone, so it's recommended to use rsrc1264 prayer. If you are too close to the walls, the snakes popping in and out of holes can hurt you as well. Its guaranteed drop, the rsrc8852, is cooked during rsrc484. However, its poison does only damage you by 1 HP. If for some reason you kill all the snakes and they don't respawn, just exit via the rope and come back in. This resets the snakes' summons, so if you were killing a snake and accidentally left, its hitpoints restore to normal and you must start anew."

They are also the strongest common chromatic dragon in-game. Black dragons are the only common chromatic dragons that drop the rsrc1398. rsrc11102, rsrc622 and the rsrc616 may be killed in place for black dragons on a slayer task. While they drop rsrc2718, rsrc363 do not count towards a black dragon task. In Taverley Dungeon, black dragons are found in the western wing of the dungeon. There are two spots; a common and slayer area. The common area only contains two black dragons, while the slayer area has twelve black dragons. The black dragons in the slayer only area can only be killed when assigned black dragons; players will be stopped by rsrc14132 if they attempt to attack them off-task. The common area requires a rsrc3067 or 70 rsrc505 (boostable) to reach the dragons, while the slayer area can be accessed by steps near the entrance. The Evil Chicken's Lair has four black dragons, the most out of any common area. Black dragons here require starting Sir Amik Varze's subquest in Recipe for Disaster, and until the rsrc5533 is redeemed, they will only drop it and their 100% drops. Accessing this area requires a rsrc935 offered to the chicken shrine in rsrc3820. Two dragons may be found in the Corsair Cove Dungeon. Accessing this area requires completion of rsrc230, but it is the closest location to a bank. Black dragons may also be found in the Wilderness in two locations; the Lava Maze Dungeon and Revenant Caves. There are two dragons in the Lava Maze Dungeon, and accessing them requires a lengthy trek through the Lava Maze, requiring a sharp weapon to cut webs. Some antipoison may be needed due to the presence of poison spiders near the dragons. There are also three dragons in the Revenant Caves; these dragons are slightly stronger to those found in the other locations mentioned above, and are the only ones that reside in a rsrc1675. These dragons are avoided due to being next to rsrc17721, a high traffic area and with little means to escape if attacked by other players. Players are not recommended to kill black dragons in the Wilderness unless part of a Wilderness slayer assignment, as doing so runs the risk of being killed by other players.  In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550. "

When the game was first released, Black Knights were the strongest foes at level 46, and only three of them existed."

He is reasonably powerful for his level; but his attacks are inaccurate and very slow. He can be fought with melee, magic or range. If the last blow dealt to him is not done with rsrc5969, he regenerates all his hitpoints and players must kill him again. Since the titan is immobile, players with a fast weapon may employ a hit-and-run technique to kill the titan without being hit. Players can also use a rsrc498 from two squares away to melee him without taking damage. Players will only gain one rsrc19 for every point of damage they deal against him (this is not the case when fighting the Black Knight Titan in the rsrc238). He also must be fought every time the player wants to pass him until rsrc7723 becomes king. When he is killed, players will receive a message saying: \"Well done, you have defeated the Black Knight Titan!\" He can be fought in the Nightmare Zone after the quest is complete. Excalibur is not required when fighting him there. "

Black unicorn foals, unlike their parents, rarely drop rsrc4917, an important ingredient when making rsrc1037 potions using the rsrc771 skill. Because of this, they are very rarely killed and are generally ignored.

They appear while doing rsrc91 when the player digs for a clue directed by the rsrc5866 or coordinates, in rsrc5445 areas. Their attack is not considered rsrc507, rsrc78 or rsrc59 and as such cannot be nullified by rsrc7104. Brassican Mages have low rsrc30, so rsrc507 or rsrc78 is advised. Magic is not advised as they are resistant due to their high Magic level. Because a player cannot pray against a Brassican Mage's attack, having plenty of rsrc184 before the fight is essential, especially considering that the strange device damages the player after every use. Although protection prayers do not work against them, it can be useful to use defensive prayers such as rsrc13068 to increase your overall defence. It is even more useful to use rsrc1266 or rsrc5310(depending on combat style) to increase both your defence and your rsrc507/rsrc78 stats. Wearing rsrc1129 or a charged rsrc2466 is useful in deflecting some damage back onto the Mage. Also setting up a cannon is highly helpful. For Brassican Mages fought in the rsrc464, bring items you are prepared to lose.  The Brassican Mage's name comes from the genus rsrc17728, which includes cabbage. The mage wields a rsrc4044, which is a possible reward from medium rsrc82."

The brine rats are relatively weak, but it is recommended to bring food if you have less than 70 rsrc30. Olaf has an infinite rsrc1188 located beside him, and the unnoted rsrc2531 drops can be collected and cooked on the fire, just outside the brine rat cave. Brine rats can also be killed as an alternative for a rsrc4222 rsrc3482 provided the player has 47 Slayer. rsrc78 and rsrc16397 may attack behind the skeletons and bones lying throughout the room to rsrc16428 the rats. The best location being behind the bones in the north-west corner. Bringing a rsrc470 and a couple of rsrc557 may be advisable if staying there for a while due to their rsrc2531/rsrc752 drop. A rsrc984 is usable in the rsrc9021. "

With just one alone, some damage will be inflicted. It is the only metallic dragon that does not drop the very rare rsrc1398. Due to that and their lackluster drops aside from the rare rsrc2148 or rsrc5409, they are not as commonly killed as other rsrc16536. If they are fought without complete dragonfire protection, it is recommended to stay in melee range and use rsrc1264, to reduce the amount of dragonfire damage taken.

They can be found while cutting rsrc16595, rsrc16596 or rsrc16597 bushes. They use rsrc59 attacks which can drain a player's combat stats. They are highly resistant to conventional attack methods, but certain consumables can be used on them to damage them: When using the correct consumable on the victim, they will suffer high (up to around 30) damage. If a player wishes to fight Broodoo victims without using items, a fast weapon such as a rsrc633 is best due to the low damage they take, and they can be inflicted with rsrc296 or rsrc1342 to add more damage over time. rsrc5495 will make the player immune to their attacks, as well as preventing stat drain. There is a tribal statue in the area that can be used to recharge rsrc81 points after completing the rsrc509 rsrc15898. If a player uncovers a Broodoo victim and leaves the area without killing it, it may remain there for a certain amount of time, and will be aggressive to any players that go near it.

    "article-text": "Brutal black dragons are rsrc6905 requiring level 77 rsrc285 in order to be damaged and are a tougher version of rsrc553. They are found in the rsrc1323. Players can kill them as an alternative for a black dragon rsrc3482. Players can access the dragons by heading towards the Dragon's Den and running past the rsrc503 and rsrc620, or alternatively, use the hole found in the rsrc2029 to take them there immediately (this requires climbing up the rope from inside the catacombs first). Like all rsrc5451, they use rsrc507, rsrc59 and long-range rsrc1395. Using both rsrc5495 (with a couple of rsrc16466) and an rsrc1457 will completely protect players from damage, if players don't stand in Melee range. Due to the brutal black dragon's unique drop table, it is the best way for rsrc16104 to obtain a rsrc5523 if specifically hunting for one, as the only other way of obtaining one is through the rsrc550, which has a much rarer drop rate. However, many ironmen obtain one on the way to 77 Slayer if using a rsrc4309. Estimated drop rates are based off 1,000 kills.rsrc274 There is a 1 in 128 chance of hitting the unique drop table.  In addition to the drops above, this monster approximately has a 3/128 chance to access the rsrc16088. In addition to the drops above, this monster approximately has a 1.5/128 chance to access the standard rsrc550.  Brutal black dragons are the only rsrc5538 that are rsrc6905. The Magic attack projectile of the brutal black dragon resembles rsrc848. Brutal black dragons are the only monster to have two items from the mega-rare subtable of the rsrc550 on their standard drop table (rsrc6463 and rsrc5523). Upon release, brutal black dragons did not have any Slayer requirement and dropped the rsrc4348 at the same rate as mithril dragons. Due to player complaints about how profitable they were without any requirements (other than combat) in addition to devaluing a unique mithril dragon drop, rsrc16185 was added to require players to have 77 Slayer to harm them and removed the dragon full helm from their drop table. Brutal black dragons are the only Slayer monsters in the Catacombs of Kourend that do not have a rsrc5158."

They are immune to poison. Brutal green dragons can be slain as an alternative for a green dragon rsrc3482. Unlike other brutal and high-levelled dragons, brutal green dragons do not drop the rsrc1398. For its rsrc173, brutal green dragons are fairly weak against rsrc78. The dragon can be effectively fought using rsrc3167 ranging, the rsrc5495 rsrc81 and sufficient rsrc17729 protection (e.g. rsrc1391, rsrc1457). Bring rsrc1044, antifire potions and rsrc1029. The dragons will use rsrc507 if an opponent walks close to them. They do not move to attack with Melee as they rely on their rsrc59 attack and firebreath attack to inflict their significant damage. You do not need an anti dragonfire shield, an anti-fire potion is enough protection for you to take 0 damage. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the standard rsrc550.

    "article-text": "Bryophyta, the Moss Giantess, is an ancient and mystical rsrc1322 rsrc1708 who can be found in her lair in the rsrc17098. Bryophyta's lair is located just north of where the moss giants reside in the sewers, accessible by the rsrc17200 from the rsrc3317 (51 rsrc505 required) or through the Varrock Sewers. In order to access Bryophyta's lair, the player must obtain a rsrc8108 from a rsrc1322. Each mossy key permits for only one attempt, similar to accessing rsrc882's lair with a rsrc6420. Warning: If you die within the lair, there is absolutely no way for you to retrieve items lost on rsrc2672! In order to reach Bryophyta, players will need a knife or blade (to slash the web to get to the lair) if they are reaching her via the rsrc4220. Members with level 51 rsrc505 can access an agility rsrc17346 by rsrc3738 in the rsrc3317. Unlike Obor's chambers (where he is confined in a small pit), players are immediately taken to Bryophytha's chambers, where she will attack them on sight - prior to entering the room, activate rsrc5495. She is also capable of rsrc296 players, starting at 8 damage, so it is recommended to bring some form of poison protection to cure her poison. Unlike rsrc882, she does not take protection prayers into account. During the fight, she may summon three rsrc15176 - they are fairly weak, but they must be killed, as Bryophyta is immune to all damage while they are alive. In order to finish them, an axe or secateurs must be used (not wielded) on them. If a player has forgotten either one of these items, they can grab a rsrc3549 from a pile of logs near her. She can only have one batch of growthlings in the chambers throughout the whole fight, but can summon more if the previous batch were killed off. F2P players are recommended to bring rsrc17732 for the increased magic defence, aswell as a rsrc1260 and rsrc475 for the most optimal setup against her attacks. Regarding offence the player is best of with a rsrc364. The recommended stats for fighting Bryophyta is a minimum of 50 in strength, attack and defence. rsrc17733 is the scientific name for moss. Bryophyta is the first rsrc375 monster capable of poisoning. Bryophyta's poison attack was forgotten to be put Free to Play."

They are found on the third level of the rsrc3405. They cast the rsrc59 spell rsrc3185 (which appears as a spraying white sparkle) to drain up to 15% of their opponent's maximum rsrc64 level.

They can use melee and magic attacks often and cast Weaken at the same time. After the spell has decreased 10 Strength levels, Catablepon will stop casting Weaken. rsrc78 or magic attacks are recommended for those attempting to kill Catablepons. On the west side of northwestern room, there is a ranged and mage rsrc8361 behind the \"Stinking tendrils\" available. Walk into the western door and the western most tile behind the tendrils. Another safe spot is in the same room. Enter from the southern door and stand against the wall beside the door. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550.

They are found in the rsrc17738, and stronger variants can be located in the rsrc6284. They are a good source of low level herbs, which can aid beginning players in training rsrc771. Significantly more powerful Cave bugs, with a combat level of 96, can be found in the Dorgesh-Kaan South Dungeon, located south of the city of rsrc1271, but can only be accessed after the completion of the rsrc3232 quest. A rsrc15946 is required for these dungeons, along with a rope to place down on the hole leading to the Lumbridge Swamp Caves, if it has not been done so previously. Players should be on the lookout for rsrc17739 within the Lumbridge Swamp Caves, which are monsters that will grab and attack you, if you are in their line of sight. To avoid being hit, either stand one square directly beside a hole in the wall and run across to the other side, or have a rsrc9540 equipped. Defeating a Cave bug in the Lumbridge Swamp Caves is a requirement for the easy rsrc608 tasks. "

    "article-text": "Cave crawlers are rsrc6905 that require level 10 rsrc285 to kill. They can inflict poison, so it is advised that players bring rsrc1037 potions when fighting them. They are the only enemy to drop rsrc3636. They also drop a variety of rsrc771 ingredients, which can be helpful for lower level players looking for an alternative source of herbs over more popular sources, such as rsrc17740. Players with very low rsrc30 should use rsrc78 or rsrc59 to attack these monsters in order to avoid being damaged and possibly poisoned, utilizing the rocks around the room's walls in rsrc7501 as safe spots. When fighting cave crawlers in the rsrc4125, be aware that any exposed rsrc3390 (i.e rsrc2048) may explode, and can cause a considerable amount of damage. As such, a rsrc3878 is recommended as it is not an exposed light source. You can use the rsrc16021 just outside as a fast means of banking. As mentioned above, players are advised to bring rsrc1037 potions as cave crawlers have a chance to poison you when they hit. They also drop the ingredients to make them yourself. Note that it is recommended to use rsrc1055 as it is cheapest antipoison available, and it lasts for 12 minutes for each dose. Much like rsrc17741, cave crawlers regenerate their health back quickly, gaining back 1 hitpoint after every attack. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the rsrc16088. "

    "article-text": "Cave horrors are assigned by rsrc6317, rsrc5775 and rsrc7309 after completing the quest rsrc2644. Killing cave horrors requires 58 rsrc285, a rsrc10346, and a rsrc15946 (unless a rsrc17744 is lit) to see in the caves. Cave horrors are often killed for their rsrc1710 drops along with a decent rate of hard clue drops. A witchwood icon must be worn at all times while in close combat with cave horrors; if not worn, they will deal damage equal to 10% of the player's total Hitpoints level rounded down (e.g. 7 damage at 76 HP or 9 at 98). However, a witchwood icon is not required if the player always has rsrc1264 active or is using rsrc8361. Cave horrors are found inside rsrc4562. To get there, players may do any of the following: Cave horrors use a rsrc9243, so it is advised that players bring rsrc3050 or other rsrc4920 that provides rsrc59 rsrc30 bonus. Players must also be wearing a rsrc10346, which can be purchased from any rsrc1956. The cave horror will use a scream attack which WILL NOT reduce a player's stats however will deal damage to a player based upon their rsrc65. Damage calculation (Player's HP level/10) rounded down to the lowest integer. However, the witchwood icon is NOT necessary when fighting them from a distance or when using the rsrc1264 prayer, so a better amulet may be used instead. Since cave horrors are wider than one square, a rsrc5001 or a rsrc4995 can be very useful as a rsrc15915 weapon, and can sometimes be used in the right areas to rsrc16428 the cave horrors behind the mushrooms, stalagmites, and boulders. Note: It is advisable to keep the witchwood icon in case of a close combat encounter. Estimated drop rates are based off 9,397 kills.rsrc274 In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the rsrc16088.  "

In order to attack a cave kraken, a player must disturb a whirlpool, causing the cave kraken to surface. Magic is the only reliable way of dealing damage to them, as rsrc78 attacks are heavily reduced, and rsrc507 cannot be used. Their projectile resembles rsrc842. It's generally not recommended to kill cave krakens if the player can kill their boss variant, as they have extremely poor drops which does not cover the cost of the runes needed per cast. However, ironmen often kill cave krakens due to their more frequent uncharged trident drop. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the rsrc16088.   Cave kraken use the same model as the rsrc12244 but it is recoloured and resized. Cave kraken and their boss variant are similar to RuneScape 3's Strykewyrms, which can only be attacked while on a Slayer task and must be disturbed to fight."

    "article-text": "Cerberus is a level 318 rsrc1326 boss that is located in rsrc7370, deep beneath the rsrc2922 in the cave entrance in the north-east part of the hellhound area which is found beyond the rsrc17747. There are three identical lairs guarded by the rsrc5106. Players can choose whichever lair to fight Cerberus. Cerberus occasionally drops rsrc7369 (1/64), which can be used to teleport to the area immediately; otherwise, players typically will get to Cerberus through the regular method of running from rsrc368 or rsrc437. Cerberus requires both a rsrc285 level of 91 to kill and a rsrc16024 of Cerberus herself or hellhounds. In the event of the latter, Cerberus can be killed while under the effects of the rsrc5704, provided that it boosts the player's Slayer level to 91 or higher. It is the only monster to drop rsrc5433, rsrc5951 and rsrc8518 crystals, which can be attached to the rsrc5317, rsrc5950 and rsrc4697 boots respectively, providing rsrc17748 boots for each combat style \u2014 rsrc5321, rsrc5949 and rsrc8517. In addition, she is also able to drop a rsrc5412, which when combined with a rsrc68, rsrc96, or a rsrc5467 can add a \"heat element\" to the tools, allowing them to become an rsrc390, rsrc5513 or rsrc5468, respectively. If a player has recently fought the boss, a line of fire will spawn between the entrance and the boss; stepping over this will deal 5 damage each way. The line of fire may be bugged, as it will not despawn unless the challenger dies to Cerberus or goes back through the line of fire after it respawns. Cerberus will restore all of its health if there are no players in its lair (it only has an examine option when this happens). A rsrc984 cannot be set up inside Cerberus' Lair; if attempted, you will receive the message: You cannot place the cannon here, it would melt. When approaching her, Cerberus will become aggressive. She may attack with magic, ranged and melee attacks, each with a max hit of 23. The magic attack appears as a grey ball, the ranged attack appears as a ball of spikes, and the melee attack is her biting. Interestingly, she may use the melee attack at range. Cerberus has three special attacks that she may use under certain circumstances: Once defeated, Cerberus will respawn in five seconds. Estimated drop rates are based off 1,000 kills.rsrc274 The mean average value of one kill is 86,864.22, excluding the loot from clue scrolls. There is a 1 in 128 chance of hitting the unique drop table. Below lists the effective drop rates.  In Greek and Roman mythology, Cerberus is a multi-headed hellhound with a serpent's tail, a mane of snakes, and a lion's claws, guarding the entrance of the Greek underworld to prevent the dead from escaping and the living from entering. This reflects the area around Cerberus as it guards the rivers that take souls to the Underworld and explains the very rare drop rsrc7242. Cerberus stands on a trapdoor as a reference to the book/film rsrc17749, also known as rsrc17750 in some territories which explains the 4 stone/crystal drops. At one point, if a player had killed the last Cerberus of their task but also happened to die in the room, the player would be unable to recover their items as entering the boss chamber required the player to be on a rsrc1326 task. This was changed so that the player can enter the chamber, but is simply unable to attack the boss. Along with the said change, the summoned spirits it calls were also given weapons so that challengers could easily identify the rsrc10737 they would be using. Along with the said change, the summoned spirits it calls were also given weapons so that challengers could easily identify the rsrc10737 they would be using. Upon release, the summoned souls would continue attacking the player even if Cerberus died. This is no longer the case with the 16 March 2017 update. Cerberus is the only rsrc17751 whose attacks are fully protected by rsrc7104. When bones are used on Cerberus, a quote is given \"Those aren't Cerby snacks.\" This is a reference to \"Scooby snacks,\" in Scooby-Doo."

    "article-text": "Chaos druids are low-level rsrc2859 commonly killed for their consistent drops of rsrc1646. Unlike most rsrc5591, they worship both rsrc2168 and rsrc1220. They attack using their fists and also use the rsrc3189 spell, which takes the appearance of rsrc8124 and binds their target very briefly if successful. The Chaos druids' weakness is rsrc78. Beware of rsrc518 in the rsrc3317, as it is a popular place to train for players with low rsrc30. They are one of very few low-level rsrc16020 with access to the rsrc550, along with their already profitable rsrc273; as such, even high-level players can frequently be found fighting them. Since the druids will commonly drop rsrc819 and rsrc1100, you should bring a rsrc839 to cast rsrc871 for quick rsrc1074 trips with almost no cost. Alternatively, for players fighting chaos druids in the rsrc2922, it's advisable to bring at least 1 rsrc875 to cast rsrc879. Ironman accounts may benefit from the frequent law rune drops at a low level. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the rsrc16088."

They hit fairly often, even through tough armour such as Torag's. They give rsrc285 experience if one's rsrc16024 is rsrc16301. Although they have high hitpoints for their level, chaos dwarves are not a good monster to train on because of their accuracy. On occasion, they may drop a rsrc6375 which will get you quite an amount of mid-level rsrc16391 if you manage to get to the rsrc6376. Both the dwarves in the rsrc464 and rsrc2922 drop the rsrc17753. Range seems to work better than melee. It is revealed in rsrc16244 that they are the result of experiments by rsrc9684 in their attempt to conquer rsrc672. The physical form of the chaos dwarves are unlike any other dwarf in rsrc3096. The rsrc17754 entry rsrc17755 describes the appearance of a chaos dwarf: \"He was like no dwarf I'd ever seen in Keldagrim. His skin was dark red and had a rough texture, and it seemed to glow from within like lava... Even unconscious, his face was locked in a grimace of rage. He smelled of sulphur and radiated unmistakable heat... \"...The heat was growing stronger. I stepped back, and Hilda did the same. The dwarf's skin glowed brighter and brighter red and then began to disintegrate, crumbling in on itself like wood curling up in a fire... In less than a minute he was gone, leaving only a few bones and some scorched armour fragments in a thinning cloud of black smoke...\" In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550."

    "article-text": "The Chaos Elemental is a dark cloud with six tentacles that dwells in the rsrc16256 section of the rsrc464, just west of the rsrc17759. This area is moderately easy to access from the deep rsrc17760 in rsrc23 or rsrc259. A rsrc10601 can randomly teleport players southeast of the Rogue's Castle. The Chaos Elemental is sometimes sought after for its rsrc2097, rsrc96, and rsrc11827 drops. In addition, it is immune to rsrc1342\u2014any items that are able to inflict venom will inflict regular rsrc296 instead. WARNING: As this boss is located deep within the Wilderness, and wanders around in a multi-combat zone, beware of player-killers! Do not bring items you are not willing to lose. The Chaos Elemental respawns after 2 minutes and 30 seconds. The Chaos Elemental's primary attack, a projectile attack, is a series of different colours fired at the target. This attack can deal either rsrc59, rsrc78, or rsrc507 damage \u2014 it is impossible to distinguish what damage is dealt until the attack hits. The projectiles hit into the 20s, but it is still suggested that players utilise rsrc5495 to reduce the chance of being hit, as the projectile deals magic damage most frequently. It also has two rsrc15915. The first one teleports players a short space or several spaces away from it. The second attack unequips items that players are wielding, forcing them to take time to re-equip their rsrc4920 and rsrc358 before continuing the battle. Its attacks will continue to follow the player until impact and can travel through walls. However, if a player was to bring food such as rsrc3425 to the Chaos Elemental, it will not be able to unequip the players items, because when you eat curry, the rsrc1761 will remain in the players inventory, giving the Chaos Elemental no room to remove your items. This does, however, give the Chaos Elemental a chance to use a teleportation or offensive attack in turn, so you could leave just a single empty spot in your inventory for the Chaos Elemental to unequip one of your items instead of every single one and so the Chaos Elemental does not focus on offensive spells. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550.   On release, the Chaos Elemental would use its teleport attack more frequently. This was changed in rsrc17735 on 8 February rsrc231."

He drops one of three shards required to forge rsrc3362 and rsrc7800. He has a rsrc15915 where he uses a green magical attack that explodes and can deal high damage, similar to the rsrc17761's explosive book attack. Players must run away from them to avoid damage. The fastest way to get there is by casting rsrc6380 or using its rsrc6378 equivalent. Alternatively, a rsrc3900 can teleport players to the entrance of the rsrc2921; run west from there. Alternately for players with the hard wilderness diary complete and a POH obelisk, you can select level 44 wilderness teleport. One quote is said every time the Chaos Fanatic attacks the player. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550.   The Chaos Fanatic's animation (apart from attacking) is similar to rsrc9688 before he is sober. The Chaos Fanatic's quote, \"I shall call him squidgy and he shall be my squidgy!\" Is a reference to the Disney movie Finding Nemo. The Chaos Fanatic's quote, \"All your wilderness are belong to them!\" is a reference to a popular catchphrase in the early 2000's, \"All your base are belong to us,\" which originated in the 1989 game Zero Wing and made it into many games in some form, including Warcraft III, Civilization III, Halo, Guild Wars, Neopets, Rome: Total War, Age of Empires, Empire Earth, and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2."

They function similarly to their rsrc10792. Rather than being summoned one at a time like normal death spawns, the Nechryarch summons 3 chaotic spawns immediately when it calls for them. The chaotic spawns also cover all three forms of the combat triangle; one uses melee, another uses magic, and the other one uses range. These chaotic spawns are more accurate than their normal variants and have a higher max hit of 7. However unlike their normal variants, their attacks can be blocked with rsrc7104, though the best way to deal with the chaotic spawns in single-way areas is to run away until they lose interest, as they will not target the player again when they attack the Nechryarch. In multi-way areas, they can be killed with burst/barrage spells instead. Once the Nechryarch dies, any chaotic death spawns they summoned will also despawn. Death spawns are demons, so the special abilities of the rsrc2789, rsrc1321 and rsrc1324 affect them.  Prior to an rsrc17195 on 30 March rsrc125, chaotic death spawn shared the same appearance as their normal counterpart. This was added to make them more easily identifiable; the ranged spawn wears a green torso, the magic spawn wears magic robes, and the melee spawn has its hood removed."

    "article-text": "Chickens are a type of domesticated rsrc11351 kept as livestock by rsrc1549, and they are often found inside pens in the farms of rsrc3096. Chickens are one of the weakest enemies in rsrc1469, with some chickens having the same amount of rsrc65 as a mere rsrc4222. They are often killed by low-level players training their rsrc712 rsrc58, as they have very low rsrc30 and cannot kill a player. These players can also cook their rsrc935 drops, allowing them to prolong their stay. Chickens, like most birds, count for bird rsrc285 rsrc3482, which are given by rsrc2944. Chickens are the primary source of several useful rsrc900, as when they are killed they drop raw chickens for rsrc745, rsrc2071 for rsrc81, and 5 to 15 rsrc412 for rsrc508 or rsrc316. Feathers are a commonly traded item due to their use in Fishing and Fletching, therefore, killing chickens and selling their feathers can be somewhat profitable for low level players. Many low-level players also kill chickens for combat rsrc19, as they have very low defence and rarely do any damage. Chickens will sometimes try to retreat when they have 1 hitpoint left. The chicken farm in rsrc806 is often crowded. Chickens count as birds for a Slayer assignment and can be assigned by rsrc2944 (3 exp/kill). In most populated rsrc3531, chicken coops are often full of bones, feathers, eggs, and raw chicken left by players training on the chickens. If one chooses to bury the bones and cook the chicken, they will gain a decent amount of Prayer and Cooking experience. Raw chicken can be bought from the rsrc284 and rsrc405 rsrc13038 and is required in several rsrc132. If you poison a chicken, and let it continue attacking you without it dying, eventually it lays an egg.rsrc274"

Bloated toads can be sucked up with rsrc2053 by the nearby swamp. When you kill a Chompy Bird, you will get a message which says: You scratch a notch on your bow for the chompy bird kill. After 30 kills, the player can wear rsrc4808. When a Chompy dies, it will give you a corpse, which you can pluck to gain feathers. Doing this will also place a rsrc4839 and some rsrc2071 on the ground. A Chompy bird will escape after one minute if you fail to kill it. The bird task assigned by Turael includes Chompy birds; while Chompys are a much slower kill on task than chickens players may wish to complete those tasks on Chompy Birds for progress towards diary goals with the bonuses the Slayer Helm provides. Note: Using melee will not be suitable to kill them. They will get scared and run away from you if you get too close. Completing various difficulties of the rsrc1255 will grant benefits when killing chompy birds:  When you kill it, there will still be a yellow dot on the minimap until you pluck it. The chompy bird's appearance is near to that of the extinct rsrc17762. Upon reaching 4,000 kills, a player will have earned 160,000 Ranged experience which, coupled with the 30,000 one time experience bonus for reaching 4,000 kills, yields 190,000 Ranged experience and 40,000 Hitpoints experience for completing the chompy bird hunting. Attempting to drop a bloated toad at the quest location after Big Chompy Bird Hunting is done will yield the message: 'Rantz doesn't like it when you chompy hunt on his turf. But you can hunt for chompys in the rest of the ogre area.'"

It is found in the rsrc464 area of the rsrc3317, by the rsrc17763. A pathway to Chronozon can now be found near the skeletons west of the Wilderness area entrance. Chronozon must be hit with all four elemental rsrc4293 in order to be killed, or otherwise it will return to full health when it is nearly dead. Players should note that Chronozon has to be hit (i.e. do actual damage: if the spell splashes, it will not count). It will not drop the crest part unless the player has completed most of the quest. He can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete. It is recommended to bring any method of curing rsrc296 before encountering Chronozon, because players will have to pass an area filled with rsrc8198 that will attack you before you reach Chronozon. Chronozon is unique in that it has to be hit with each of the 4 elemental blast spells, rsrc829, rsrc831, rsrc849 and rsrc867. A message will appear in the chatbox, saying \"Chronozon weakens\" to confirm that the spell has been made effective. Once all 4 elemental spells have been cast on Chronozon, players may do as they wish to dispatch of him. Since he only uses rsrc507, continuing to mage him or ranging him is an easy way to finish him off, as there is a safespot in the area. However, Melee can also be used. Once defeated, it will instantly drop the rsrc22 onto the floor. Chronozon is located in rsrc3317 near the rsrc5681. Chronozon's name is likely based on rsrc17764, an abyss-dwelling demon of hallucination that rsrc17765, rsrc17766, and rsrc17767 wrote about."

A rsrc7952 is required to defend against their piercing gaze, or else they will reduce your combat stats every hit, even while safe-spotting. As 20 rsrc30 is needed to be able to wield a mirror shield, players who do not meet this requirement will not be assigned them as a task. It's worthy to note that their strength lies purely in their piercing gaze ability; with a rsrc7952 equipped, do not expect much of a fight. As such, not a lot of resources are necessary to hunt this monster. They are commonly killed because they have a relatively high drop rate of rsrc499, and are often killed during Slayer tasks. They may also rarely drop the rsrc8212. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the rsrc16088. "

Of course, if the friend option is chosen, he will let you go but if the foe one is chosen, he will attack the player. When asked why Yanille is so heavily defended, he explains that as the southernmost city of rsrc536 it must be protected from the rsrc2480 of the rsrc2059.

After the event, the chicken takes on a rainbow-coloured appearance and can be fought by groups of players simultaneously. Unlike most monsters, the Colossal Chocco Chicken does not have a rsrc173. In addition to being able to be attacked with normal weaponry, the chicken can also be damaged by chopping the support beams, mining the support columns, or burning rsrc7400 underneath him. These 'attacks' deal far more damage than normal attacks. Every few seconds, the Colossal Chicken will summon several smaller rsrc4403.

To gain access to her chamber within the rsrc17769, players must have killed 40 of Saradomin's followers throughout the dungeon. Furthermore, in addition to an rsrc505 level of 70 (cannot be boosted), players must bring two rsrc1609 on their first visit in order to navigate obstacles in the encampment. Like other God Wars Dungeon bosses, Zilyana roams around a rectangular room with her bodyguards until a player enters, attacking them on sight. She attacks with very accurate and rapid Melee and Magic attacks, and her bodyguards use a different combat style each. She will only use her Magic attacks at Melee distance. If all players leave, her health and stats will be reset. The Commander can be seen yelling several battle cries whether or not she is in combat with any players: In addition to the drops above, this monster  has a 2/127 chance to access the rsrc16088. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has a 8/127 chance to access the standard rsrc550.  While pretending to form an alliance with rsrc1664, Commander Zilyana stole the rsrc974 from rsrc1660 during the rsrc1224, keeping it as a trophy of her cunning. Following a patch on the 24th October 2013, Zilyana is susceptible to rsrc10497 and the rsrc10459. At Old School RuneScape's first rsrc124, players could speak to Commander Zilyana, resulting in the following dialogue: Player: Greetings, Zilyana. Zilyana: Commander, if you don't mind. Player: I don't, Zilyana. Zilyana: Bah, find me some more cake. oh and FIND THE GODSWORD! Player: I'll err... get some more cake alright? Player: Greetings, Zilyana. Zilyana: Commander, if you don't mind. Player: I don't, Zilyana. Zilyana: Bah, find me some more cake. oh and FIND THE GODSWORD! Player: I'll err... get some more cake alright?"

    "article-text": "The Corporeal Beast, often simply referred to as Corp, is a large monster residing in its cave, accessible via a rsrc3846 or through an entrance in level 21 rsrc464 east of the rsrc4163. It has a very large health pool of 2,000 rsrc65, coupled with high rsrc30 and 50% damage reduction against any weapon that's not a rsrc506 or rsrc498. If all players leave the room, it regenerates its health to full. The Corporeal Beast is the only monster to drop the rsrc1577, rsrc5769, and rsrc6977 sigils used to create the rsrc2961. In addition to its sigil drops, the Corporeal Beast has many other valuable drops. The easiest way to get to the Corporeal Beast is to teleport there using a rsrc3846 and selecting the \"Corporeal Beast\" option. This will take the player to a small safe room with a large doorway to Corporeal Beast. As of 20 November 2014, players can pay 200,000 coins to host an rsrc11750. Players ranked as rsrc12104 or above in a rsrc17771 can pay the instance cost for their clan. Once the instance is opened, anyone from the clan chat will be able to enter the instance for no cost. As long as there is one player present in the instance, it will remain open. rsrc6909 above a combat level of 90 have a separate room for Corporeal Beast, inaccessible by other players and vice versa but otherwise identical. This was added in an rsrc16539 on 29 March rsrc231, to prevent rsrc12096 and using other accounts to reduce its stats. The Corporeal Beast has a 50% damage reduction against any weapon that's not a rsrc506 or rsrc498. rsrc5495 does not fully block its magic attacks; it only reduces the damage by 33.33%. It has very high accuracy, damage, and rsrc30 for its levels. It can also summon rsrc5770, which attack players and heal itself. While fighting the Corporeal Beast, whenever it is hit above 32 damage, there is a 12.5% chance that the dark core will spawn. The core will hop between players and deal rapid damage when next to a player, with the damage dealt healing the Corporeal Beast. The core can be killed, but it may be summoned again. The rsrc4780 has a damage counter on the top-left to indicate how much damage the player has dealt, which determines who gets the loot drop once the Corporeal Beast dies. It has a respawn time of 30 seconds. There is a 1 in 585 chance of hitting the sigil drop table. When players hit the table, there is a 1 in 7 chance of obtaining an elysian sigil, a 3 in 7 chance of a spectral sigil and a 3 in 7 chance of an arcane sigil. Below lists the effective drop rates of the sigils.rsrc274 The 'Uncuts' drop is an uncommon drop from the Corporeal Beast; it either contains a cash pile varying from 20,000 to 50,000 coins or a random selection of rsrc1953 and/or rsrc8245, as well as a slim chance of getting items from the rsrc550. The overall odds of hitting the 'Uncuts Drop' is 1 in 42.66. Although the Corporeal Beast does not have a reference to the rsrc550, there is an incredibly low chance of an rsrc14260. This drop can only occur in combination with the \"uncuts\" drop. There's also a slim chance of receiving nothing as a drop. There are many differences between the iteration of this boss in Old School RuneScape and the original in RuneScape 2. In RuneScape 2, the Corporeal Beast's lair was much larger, although it only resided in the last room. The entrance to the lair was also 14 levels deeper than the one in-game. Furthermore, it could only be fought after completing the quest rsrc17772. The original Corporeal Beast could also drop a rsrc17773, which could be used to create a rsrc17774. Its effect was a constant 30% damage reduction per attack received, where the damage blocked was instead taken away from prayer points. In the 18 September 2014 poll,rsrc2761 it was asked if the divine sigil should be released as a drop from the boss, which gained 66.1% of 'yes' votes - 8.9% short of the threshold required for passing.

He is responsible for many deaths of avid adventurers who have fallen prey to his sharp fangs. Count Draynor is the target in the rsrc2414 quest which requires the player to kill him to save the people of rsrc340, who have been terrorised by Count Draynor for centuries. He is the weakest rsrc16961 in rsrc15920, owing to his leaving rsrc2264 and dwelling west of the rsrc2963. He can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete.You won't need a stake then. Killing Count Draynor does count towards vampire slayer tasks. Count Draynor can't be killed with a typical, everyday rsrc16421, but he can be damaged by one. A player needs to have a rsrc6371 and a rsrc422 and drive a stake through his heart, although players have to take almost all of his health first. If a player does not have the hammer and stake, he will heal to full health when his health points are low. It is strongly advised to bring rsrc2321 with you to weaken him. Having decent food will help for very low level players. Additionally, he is one of the only monsters in RuneScape that does not award experience in combat. However, due to Count Draynor's low magic defence, low class combat spells like rsrc864 and rsrc881 can also severely damage him, and may be a viable option. Once he is almost dead, use the stake to stab him and finish him off. If you decide to kill him with magic, many armours add negative stats to your magic skill, so make sure you remove them. Additionally, the health recovery rate of Count Draynor is very high, it's possible to have to deal damage equivalent to twice his health to kill him. This rate decreases over time if you brought Garlic. Good equipment such as rsrc17189, a rsrc2758 or rsrc588, a defensive prayer, along with a garlic will make the battle easy to mid-level players, allowing them to only use a few pieces of food. He can be killed with melee at 1 strength/1 attack by using an iron dagger(p++). The Count Draynor character is loosely based on the popular Count Dracula from a 1897 horror novel of the same name. He is one of only two Vampyres to appear in rsrc375 worlds. The other is rsrc12266. His monocle might be a reference to The Count from the children's television series rsrc17775."

While most locations containing cows are crowded, there are some spots usually vacant, like the spot north of the windmill north-west of Lumbridge. Along with cows, you can also find rsrc12268 and rsrc3824. Cows, while generally weak, are immune to rsrc296 and rsrc1342. This is reportedly due to a conflict with their 'Moo' timing interrupting poison and venom's timers. There is a very small chance for a cow to appear inside rsrc238. According to Mod Mat K (confirming player speculation), this is an easter egg referring to the cow in the area to start a dream, which couldn't be moved when the minigame was developed due to the lack of a map editor.rsrc274 Using an item on a Cow prompts the message \"The cow doesn't want that.\" as opposed to the usual \"Nothing interesting happens.\""

He uses rsrc78 and rsrc507 attacks and can perform a rsrc15915 where he throws explosive books that explode in a 3x3 area. Bellock is one of the three rsrc15044 that drop one of three shards of the rsrc7800 and rsrc3362. Despite his high rsrc59 rsrc30, he has a negligible Magic level, and thus has a weakness to Magic. This is because magic resistance is calculated primarily based on one's Magic levelrsrc274. Killing Bellock is a popular way for rsrc16104 to obtain a rsrc407 without having to train rsrc316. It is recommended to use rsrc16054 with the rsrc1354 while rsrc17778 and avoiding his rsrc15915 of explosive books as soon as he says, \"Rain of knowledge!\" The best way to avoid it is by keeping a considerable distance, and running towards him until you are two squares away from it (this way, you will avoid rsrc507 damage), and repeating the same steps over and over, you will minimize the chance of receiving damage. Another strategy is to use high rsrc78 rsrc30 rsrc4920 (like rsrc17779 and rsrc15917) with a rsrc275 or rsrc252 along side with the rsrc1264 prayer. The fastest way to get there is by using the spell rsrc856 from the rsrc120 spellbook with 78 rsrc59 or a rsrc5117 tablet. Alternatively a rsrc17780 can be used to teleport to bandit camp and run to the ruins. One quote is said every time Bellock attacks the player. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the standard rsrc550. The name \"Bellock\" is a reference to rsrc17781 from rsrc17782. The phrase \"You belong in a museum!\" is another reference to Indiana Jones. The phrase \"You belong in a museum!\" is another reference to Indiana Jones. The crazy archaeologist is the only Wilderness boss which does not drop a pet."

Another place to fight crocodiles (if rsrc778 has been completed) is just north of rsrc450, by the river just outside the gate.

He is, according to legend, an evil mage who draws his power from food. A hundred years ago, the Culinaromancer was a cook in rsrc1461 for rsrc1460. He used the exotic and esoteric foodstuffs to which he had access to improve his magical power. In the quest rsrc484, he was sealed away by rsrc10648, one of the Lumbridge Castle rsrc1541 forefathers, when he threatened to destroy a council that gets together for a feast every ten years. Eliminating the secret council would have been the first step in his plan for world domination. He can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete. The Culinaromancer uses melee and magic, and has a low combat level of 75. He should not be underestimated, despite his low combat level. He essentially has no defence, but has a staggering max hit of 25. If you are a low level and want to avoid damage, you can run away from him and attack with ranged or magic; this way he won't be able to hit you if you keep your distance. For this method, it is advised to bring a few energy potions. Freezing or rsrc3080 him and attacking him with ranged or magic is also an option. "

Bringing rsrc2768 and rsrc839 while fighting these are recommended as it can be helpful due to many of the drops being rsrc8 and allows you to make money without banking or taking up inventory space. Cyclopes are considered rsrc17783 for the purpose of a rsrc3482. Killing rsrc50 cyclopes is the only way to get a rsrc1898. When killing them, a defender may be dropped, but only one at a time in a specific order: Once a player gains their current level defender, they must show it to rsrc13442, and kill another cyclops until the next level defender will appear. Once a player gains a rsrc462, the cyclops will continue to drop rune defenders. However, players may show their rune defender to rsrc5455 in the guild basement, accessible from exiting the door in the rsrc1201. Cyclopes located in the basement have a chance of dropping rsrc250. These cyclopes, however, are slightly stronger than the ones located upstairs. Players can only attack the cyclopes with rsrc507 attacks, because they are immune to Range and Magic attacks. rsrc2827 will only work if the rsrc17784 is Scorch (trains rsrc64), but if it is on Flare (trains rsrc78) or Blaze (trains rsrc59), the attack will not hit because they are considered attacks at a distance. Note: the cyclops found in Ardougne Zoo shares the same drop table as hill giants. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the standard rsrc550. "

Dad can be re-fought in the rsrc238 minigame after the player has completed rsrc4252. Since nearly all trolls are named after the thing they first ate, Dad got his name from eating (or trying to eat) his father. This is further confirmed by Dad himself, as Dad replies \"Troll named after first thing try to eat!\" if a player asks about his name. He challenges players, either doing rsrc4252 or not, to fight him in the rsrc13484 so players can pass him and have access to the northern side of Troll Country, including the rsrc467. He will stop the player from attacking just before he dies to ask you to spare his life. It is recommended that you spare his life, because if you choose to kill him after he has surrendered, he will drop rsrc2475 and you may continue, but all the rsrc674 in the arena will become aggressive towards you and will try to kill you, so if you kill him, be ready to run to the northern gate. If you just let him live, he will allow you to pass through the gate anyway, and the troll spectators won't become aggressive. Dad is larger and stronger than normal Trolls, so much that he actually wields a large, hollow tree trunk in battle. He is very powerful and can hit into the high 20s. His hits are slow, but fast at times. When he hits there is a 1/3 chance that he will do a giant swing that sends player flying through the air, knocking them back and momentarily rsrc3080 them. rsrc1264 is recommended when fighting him. Despite his strength, Dad is notable for being one of two non-rsrc16139 trolls which can be fought, the others being rsrc674. You should stay near a wall while fighting him as this prevents his giant swing from knocking you back, although it will still rsrc3080. Dad is unable to walk through players, so one possible strategy is to have a friend stand in his way so he can't get close enough to attack. Once Dad is defeated, the player can no longer attack him.

After players finish rsrc2221, regular rsrc1319 are found there. They can also be found in the south part in the rsrc1323. The dagannoth here only use melee attacks. There are two varieties \u2014 level 74 and 92. The level 74 uses a rsrc78 attack that hits up to 10, but has poor accuracy (the level 74's in the rsrc1323 use melee). The level 92 dagannoth uses rsrc507, which is more accurate and hits up to 8. These dagannoth are in a rsrc1675 and therefore many players use rsrc17785 to train here. Despite the rsrc712 level of these dagannoth, they are considered very weak by most players especially in comparison to the stronger rsrc17786 dagannoth. They also seem to be susceptible to poison. If you are planning to stay here for a longer period, rsrc3315 is a good way for healing and one of the most cost effective ways. The use of rsrc1127 armour is also a good way to stay for an extended period of time, but since it degrades, it is not always the best method of healing. You can also bring a rsrc9228 and use its healing special attack to restore some life and rsrc16116 since it only uses 50% of the special bar. Some players choose to bring noted food, sell it to rsrc1298 on the first floor, and then buy it back in unnoted form for a small loss. Players with decent defensive bonuses shouldn't have any trouble fighting for long periods of time. For those with level 80 prayer and using a cannon, a dragonbone necklace and bone crusher may be used for infinite protect from melee, with only moderate prayer bonuses. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550. "

The level 90 Dagannoth use an accurate melee attack, which hits often and hard against players. Protect from Melee, or Barrows armour or better, and food is recommended. The level 88 Dagannoth use a fast and very accurate ranged attack. Level 90 Dagannoth are found in the main room (single combat area), and the multi-combat areas. Level 88 Dagannoth are in the southern path to go deeper inside the dungeon and also in multi-combat areas. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550. "

Dagannoth fledgelings are bad for training as although they won't attack players (being too busy with Bardur) and they have high rsrc65, they provide no combat or rsrc285 experience. Another downside is that they are located deep in the rsrc1599. Dagannoth fledgelings are located near rsrc6238, who will give cooked rsrc17789 in exchange for rsrc6237, rsrc6235, and rsrc6236.

She can hit up to 16s with rsrc507, and can hit double 12s with rsrc78. rsrc299 are advised to bring a rsrc1129 and turn off rsrc17667 if not using melee. It should be noted that if she is killed by any source of recoil, the player will have to leave the area and repeat the fight (this may be a glitch). As a result, players should unequip their rings of recoil when she has low health. Once she is defeated, you will obtain a rusty casket. She can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete.

Prime is the only monster to drop the rsrc7689 and rsrc1353. His projectile resembles rsrc842. He, along with the other Dagannoth Kings, can also drop the rsrc68. Dagannoth Prime, like the rsrc10733 suggests, is weak to rsrc78 attacks. The rsrc974, rsrc977, rsrc978, rsrc407 and rsrc1695 are effective weapons against him due to their high accuracy and, for the case of the blowpipe, very high damage-per-second capability. Wealthier players may opt to use the rsrc1671 due to its effectiveness against monsters with high magic. The rsrc794 is also an effective weapon to use, but very expensive and less so than the other alternatives given. His rsrc17598 attack is VERY powerful and more potent than the other two kings; it can deal 50 rsrc65 of damage in one hit, so rsrc5495 prayer is a MUST whenever Dagannoth Prime is on you. Meleers are advised to stay away from Dagannoth Prime at all costs and fend off rsrc457 meanwhile, as Dagannoth Prime can kill any player not using the Protect from Magic prayer within a couple of attacks and is resistant to rsrc507 attacks. Dagannoth Prime still has medium rsrc30 against ranged attacks. The most efficient way to kill Dagannoth Prime is to stand in the north-east corner of the lair while not being under attack by rsrc393 or Dagannoth Supreme, using a ranged weapon. "

Rex is the only monster to drop the coveted rsrc2461 and rsrc10258; the former can be sold for a hefty price. He, along with the other Dagannoth Kings, can also drop the rare rsrc68. Dagannoth Rex has an extremely low rsrc17723. Therefore, it is recommended to use rsrc59 against him for better hits; popular choices are rsrc17797, rsrc855, rsrc5180 and rsrc1358. For best damage per second, players should use a rsrc276 for the 15% damage boost (stacks with rsrc858 spell), as well as its ability to autocast rsrc837. Another more popular alternative is the use of the rsrc1354 or rsrc17798. Using any of these strategies in conjunction with the rsrc16537, a player can now deal out extra damage if they are on a rsrc1319 task. rsrc57 may be used with Staff of the dead or Trident of the seas/swamp for an extra 10% magic damage. Due to his large size, the fact he uses rsrc507 attacks only and the surroundings he is in, it is recommended to get him stuck on one of the ridges of the lair and rsrc16428 him (note that rsrc9645 will still be constantly attacking while you're safespotting him). Many players use high-level rsrc4920 such as rsrc16290, which give high rsrc30 bonuses while still being able to hit Rex constantly with rsrc16576 due to his very low Magic Defence, even if their rsrc17799 is below zero. Players who use rsrc1127 are advised heal themselves on the Spinolyps while waiting for Rex to re-spawn to help preserve rsrc184 and rsrc16794. There is a 1 in 128 chance of rolling the talisman table.rsrc2761 In addition to the drops above, this monster  has a 1/16 chance to access the standard rsrc550. "

Supreme is the only monster to drop the rsrc17800 and rsrc9299. He, along with the other Dagannoth Kings, can also drop the fabled rsrc68. His Ranged attack sounds like the rsrc842 spell when hitting players, and, in a similar fashion to rsrc59 attacks, will \"splash\" if it misses. Dagannoth Supreme is most weak to rsrc507 attacks. The best weapons to use primarily are the rsrc252 or rsrc295 due to its high rsrc305 and fast attack rate, the rsrc9228 for its rsrc15915, accuracy, and Strength bonus, and rsrc6816, which should only be used in conjunction with the full rsrc17801 to heal. If a player does not posses a Saradomin godsword, a rsrc4995 or rsrc5001 is a good alternative rsrc15915 weapon. Note if rsrc909 starts attacking, then you MUST change your rsrc16953 to rsrc5495 as his hits are devastating and can hit 50. It is highly recommended that meleers stay away from Dagannoth Prime at all costs as he can take you down within a couple hits if not using the right protection prayer. Try to stay near the ladder while killing him in case you need to make a quick escape. There is a 1 in 128 chance of rolling the talisman table.rsrc2761 "

He is the only guardian who solely uses rsrc507 to attack, however this is made up for by having two forms - the first being quite easy, while the second having higher stats, attacking faster as well as draining rsrc81 rapidly. He can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete. He is found at the end of the rsrc4585, which is accessed via a ladder requiring the rsrc6452 to see. When approaching Damis' location, the player will be told in their chatbox that they hear a voice from the walls telling them to turn back. His first form is not much of a threat as the player can use rsrc1264 to defeat him and mitigate all damage, however his second form has higher stats, attacks faster and drains the player's Prayer rapidly when close up. As such, it may not be a good idea to allow Damis to attack the player. The best method to defeat Damis is to get the attention of (but not kill) the rsrc2293 or one of two rsrc4850 found nearby and luring Damis and the other aggressive monsters behind it. Unlike the skeletons and Shadow Hounds, they will prevent other monsters passing through them. The player can then safely attack Damis using Magic/rsrc78 with only the giant rat or bat attacking the player. As Damis is weak to Magic, rsrc848 and rsrc1354/rsrc1361 are effective. He is resistant to rsrc507 and Ranged. Contrary to a popular misconception, Damis is not specifically weak to Earth spells.rsrc274 During Damis' second form, he may say one of the following quotes per rsrc1473 when he is close up to the player:  Damis is an Arabic word that means \"dark\" or \"shadows\". On release, Damis could be lured to the end of the alcove north of his room and easily rsrc16428 behind a stalagmite. This no longer works as an update changed the stalagmite to a standing torch, which does not allow attacks through it."

    "article-text": "Dark beasts are monsters that require 90 rsrc285 to kill, and are found in the rsrc9149 as well as in the Dragon's Den (north-west) area of the rsrc1323. Along with their superior variant, they are the only monster in the game to drop the rsrc1692 and the rsrc5207. Dark beasts attack with both rsrc507 and rsrc59; however, they will only use Magic if they are attacked by the player first, or if they cannot attack the player with Melee. Dark beasts do not follow rsrc10710 rules, and are always rsrc16139 to the player regardless of how long they have stayed in their presence. Their highly accurate melee attacks means that using rsrc1264 is recommended when killing dark beasts. A rsrc173 of 100 is required to have them assigned to the player as a rsrc3482, unless the player has spoken to a rsrc16096 about the difficulty of assignments; progressing through rsrc2885 to the point where the player can access the tunnels is also required, as well as 90 Slayer. Players who have a rsrc3540 and completed Mourning's End Part II can rub the ring to immediately teleport to the dark beasts in the Mourner Tunnels. Another fast method to reach these dark beasts is the rsrc4307 through the rsrc257. If the player cannot use these methods, then they will need to enter through the rsrc13445 wearing a full rsrc3024 (with no non-regulated items being worn) and the rsrc8257 to open the door. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the standard rsrc550. Upon their release, dark beasts used to look like a dark-brown version of the rsrc13557 with a black horn."

It is advised to kill the Dark Core as soon as it is launched towards the player, as it transfers the player's rsrc65 to the Corporeal Beast and in very large clans, can be quite irritating. It can be weakened immensely by rsrc17803 it. Once it has been poisoned, its attacks will be extremely slow, although there must be at least one player around the Dark energy core or else it will start hopping around again and will attack normally. If the Dark energy core was rsrc3080 but someone moved away from him and he starts hopping around again, it cannot be stunned again. It will keep dealing damage rapidly until it is killed. If the Corporeal Beast dies, the Dark Core will disappear. The dark core has a 1 in 8 chance of spawning after the Corporeal Beast has been hit 32 damage or higher."

In order to access the roof, players must obtain a rsrc3535 from rsrc253 while assigned them for a rsrc16024. Similar to other slayer rsrc1708 such as rsrc2681 and the rsrc242, the Grotesque Guardians can only be killed while the player is assigned gargoyles as a rsrc16024. To initiate the fight, players must ring the Cloister Bell in the north side of the roof. This will trigger a cutscene in which the Guardians will awaken, and the fight will begin. Dawn uses magic, ranged, and melee attacks. She has a special attack in which a grey ball is flung somewhere near her, and if the player is hit by this ball (which covers a 3x3 AoE), they will be rsrc3080 and bound, similar to the rsrc427's special attack. Like gargoyles, players must bring a rsrc6629 or rsrc3534 to defeat Dawn. In the beginning of the fight, players must attack Dawn with ranging attacks (as she cannot be harmed with melee and is resistant to magic), as rsrc11348 cannot be harmed during this phase of the fight. Once her health has reached half, both will perform a lightning special attack that has an AoE of 3x3, rapidly dealing up to 5-10 damage per tick. After doing so, she will fly away, and players must attack Dusk. Once his health has reached half, Dawn will return to perform the lightning special attack once more with Dusk. After returning, she will occasionally send out three energy spheres that will grow larger over time. Players must absorb these spheres, taking small amounts of damage if absorbed immediately, and can deal up to 20 damage if players absorb them later. If players ignore them entirely, each sphere will heal Dawn for 90 hitpoints. After defeating Dawn, Dusk will absorb her essence, and initiate the final phase of the fight.  During the opening cutscene of the fight, Dawn shares the same combat level as Dusk; however, when the fight begins, her combat level is lowered from 285 to 266. Upon release, Dawn had 600 hitpoints. This was reduced to 450 in rsrc16554 on 12 July rsrc231."

Home teleports are also unaffected by the death spawns attacks. Despite this, they can still interrupt conversation with other NPCs or other dialogue screens, such as teleport options when operating a piece of equipment. Players who use rsrc1127 may prefer to heal on death spawns rather than Nechyraels due to their lower combat stats. After being summoned by a Nechryael, the death spawn will despawn after 1 minute.

The dungeon can be found in the north-west of the rsrc2948 by searching the mossy rocks, after which the player should search the bookshelf north of rsrc190 and choose to squeeze through there, picklock the ancient door, mine the rocks and open another door to reach the death wings. Death wings can also sometimes be found inside rsrc8011 in the dungeon."

Immediately after being summoned he was confronted by rsrc13551, an ancient knight of sorts, and quickly defeated with the powerful weapon known as rsrc2789 and an incantation. For unknown reasons the cult of rsrc1220 rsrc883 at the south entrance of rsrc378 are performing the ritual to summon Delrith into this world again. Delrith is relatively easy to kill and players can evade the wizards if they take their time. Low-levelled players should exercise caution however as the wizards will deal significant damage against them. "

    "article-text": "Demonic gorillas are powerful creatures found in the rsrc2039. Two of them are fought during rsrc554, in the penultimate stage of the fight. After the quest is completed, more demonic gorillas can be found in the caverns alongside their rsrc2036 brethren. They are primarily killed for their rsrc8427 and rsrc8093 component drops. Demonic gorillas use all three rsrc10737 to attack. They will change combat styles after missing three hits in that attack style. They are also capable of using rsrc7104, and will switch to protect from the player's attack style after taking 50 damage from it. Therefore, you must bring at least two different combat styles to kill them. As they have very high magical defences, they are most often killed with melee and range. The gorillas also have a special attack where they send a rock crashing down at the player's position, which can be easily avoided by moving out of the way. If you are hit by this attack, it will deal 1/3 of the player's current HP (meaning that it alone cannot kill you) allowing it to hit over 30 damage on players with high HP. Most of the gorillas reside in a rsrc17807 area, making it very dangerous if the player is attacked by more than one at a time. However, there is a rsrc17808 area where more demonic gorillas can be fought safely. However, if they continually use their rock fall attack at the player, it is possible for nearby demonic gorillas to attack the player if they are not rsrc17809 yet. Demonic gorillas count as rsrc5922 and rsrc17810 during a rsrc3482. As they are demons, they are susceptible to the effects of rsrc2789, rsrc1321 and rsrc1324. Demonic gorillas cannot be damaged with a rsrc984. You can check the kill count by reading the gravestone next to rsrc11671 at the opening in the fence. Note: The prayers of the demonic gorilla cannot be bypassed through the use of rsrc1125 or rsrc1267. Below lists the effective drop rates of any specific item.rsrc274 In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550.   Demonic gorillas are similar to the rsrc17811 of RuneScape 3; both use all three forms of rsrc712, rsrc7104 and drop items that are used to create more powerful equipment. Demonic gorillas' prayers were slightly changed several days after release due to several glitches happening with specific weapons, notably the rsrc9228."

He's exactly the same as the rsrc1120 in terms of rsrc712 and rsrc28 - he throws books as a rsrc78 attack, and punches and kicks nearby players. As his rsrc15915, it's fairly the same, except he yells \"Learn to Read!\", and that the orange books deal much more damage.  Upon release, the Deranged Archaeologist dropped uncharged rsrc266 at an uncommon rate. As the amulet of glory is one of the most coveted rsrc17812 items (which had high requirements - either 83 rsrc1887 to catch rsrc1092, or 80 rsrc263 to create), this caused player complaints about making it far too easy to obtain. This was changed and now he drops rsrc4577 instead. Upon release, the Deranged Archaeologist could be rsrc17724. To counter this, rsrc2868 added an attack (indicated by him shouting No hiding!), allowing him to damage players if he cannot attack them.

Ice coolers must be used on a Desert lizard to defeat them, you may use it when it has 4 hp or less to instantaneously kill them. Desert lizards are fairly weak foes, and can be taken down with ease. The lizards are located south-east of the rsrc1089, across the rsrc1182, roaming around south of the area where orange salamanders can be caught. The easiest route to get there is by taking a rsrc1087 ride to the temples of rsrc2790, then heading south-west. Alternatively, players with access to fairy rings can use the code dlq to get to them faster. The lizards are found in areas affected by rsrc2708, so players are advised to bring a rsrc3426 source like rsrc4379 to avoid taking damage from the heat. Those with access to the fairy ring system can easily refill waterskins by re-entering rsrc3820; as a water fountain is located north of the fairy ring. Desert lizards can be assigned as a rsrc3482 by rsrc2944, rsrc8256, rsrc6317, and rsrc3738. Although the task says \"Desert Lizard\", you don't necessarily have to kill just desert lizards. Any other lizards around the area are counted toward the task. The final blow cannot be dealt by using rsrc120 rsrc10497.  In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the rsrc16088. "

They are aggressive to players level 54 rsrc712 and below. Anyone under its level should be extremely careful and make sure they have plenty of waterskins and rsrc184.

Ranged works well too. A very effective method using melee is wearing full melee void set and a fast weapon. Using Dragon Dagger (p++) special attack is also very effective. He can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete. Note: If magic is used to attack him, bring strong melee-resistant armour. He hits hard and fast with rsrc507 (around the same speed as throwing rings) and can use magic attacks that hit rapid 5's, similar to his rsrc2955 counterpart. Once a player enters the portal, they should waste no time and head straight for him, unleashing attacks on him. If you are using magic, you should use a combination of snaring/binding and Iban's blast/wind spells. This will easily take him down with little to no use of food. At high magic levels, it is possible to only have to bind him once or twice."

He must be killed during the rsrc1336 quest. The player is told of Dessous by rsrc2954, one of the four guardians of the rsrc2095, who wants him dead in order to claim Dessous' land as his own. In order to achieve this, Malak tells the player that Dessous guards the diamond and if they wish to retrieve it they must eliminate him; it is when the player encounters Malak after the fight that he confesses that he is the real guardian and that Dessous was just an enemy of his, and then gives the diamond to the player as a reward for their troubles. He can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete. The rsrc13354, in the south-east of rsrc2891. To begin the fight, players must use a rsrc2957 containing blood, rsrc2321 and rsrc1934 on his grave. Dessous uses two attacks: a rapid rsrc507 attack (the same speed as rsrc16474) which is accurate and can hit up to 19, and a bat attack indicated by bats flying towards the player, with Dessous saying \"Hssssssssssss\", which is half rsrc59, half rsrc78, each inflicting 5 hitpoints for a total of 10 hitpoints. The delay in which this attack hits the player seems to be random. Dessous will detect a player's rsrc7104 and switch attack style accordingly. Players who will not be wearing melee rsrc807 are advised to activate rsrc1264, otherwise players who are should use rsrc5495/rsrc3014 so that he will only use melee. If players try to hit Dessous from a long distance away, he will teleport next to them, and if Dessous teleports three times he will get \"bored of toying with you\" and go back to his grave (this means the player will have to refill the silver pot and start the fight again). Dessous is weak to Magic, especially rsrc10520, as well as Ranged and Stab. rsrc848 and rsrc1354/rsrc1361 are also effective. Dessous is immune to the effects of rsrc16085. If any part of the quest is not followed correctly (for example, if the pot is not blessed), Dessous will say \"You will never defeat me\" when reduced to 0 life points and regenerate all his life points, ready to fight again, so be careful! To avoid this keep full concentration at all times while making the blessed pot of blood.  Dessous is a French word that means \"beneath\"."

Although they have a slightly better drop table than aberrant specters and the ability to drop rsrc1311 and rsrc4516 pieces, their rsrc30 levels are notably higher, making them overall slower to kill. The player would also almost certainly have to use rsrc5495 as they are aggressive and found in a multi-combat zone, as opposed to using armour with high rsrc15950. However, some players who can afford a rsrc1671 may choose to kill Deviant spectres when assigned for a task, as they drop dark totem pieces and require little effort with Protect from Magic on due to their high rsrc59 level and hence weakness to the Twisted bow. They are susceptible to the effects of the rsrc17820 and its variants. Like aberrant spectres, deviant spectres will heal 1 hp for every time they attack the player, so much so as being able to out heal rsrc296, so it is more efficient to kill a single deviant spectre one at a time than to alternate between multiple targets. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550. "

He uses rsrc507 equipment, which make him vulnerable to rsrc59 attacks. Dharok's set effect is Wretched Strength, which increases his max hit by 1% for each rsrc16130 he is missing. Due to him being able to hit up to 64 at 1 hitpoint remaining, it is strongly recommended to keep rsrc1264 active at all times. He uses slash attacks, although relying on armour should not be taken into account as Protect from Melee is advised. If a player runs out of rsrc81 points when fighting Dharok, it is advisable to retreat since he can hit high and a rsrc4896 is very unlikely to activate. Dharok is commonly defeated with the use of a rsrc1361/rsrc1354, rsrc848 or rsrc1366. Players can also use rsrc8121 or rsrc10497 on Dharok to attack him from a distance - however this is not recommended due to the likelihood that he will unfreeze on low health, possibly dealing a large amount of damage.

They call \"I expect you to die!\" upon appearing. Double agents attack exclusively with rsrc507; as such, activating rsrc1264 completely negates their damage. They are not particularly weak to any attack style. If the double agent is killed while the player is wearing the equipment instructed to wear for the clue, rsrc3517 will immediately appear. For double agents fought in the Wilderness, only bring items you are prepared to lose.  Their appearance is identical to rsrc3517. The phrase \"I expect you to die!\" is most likely a reference to the 1964 film Goldfinger."

    "article-text": "Ducks are small animals which can be found in rivers or lakes. They are very small and drop rsrc2071 when found on ground. They are a fairly good way to start training the rsrc59 skill with low-Level rsrc3184 spells and even rsrc11171. The best place to kill ducks in a rsrc17 world is the rsrc4613, because there are plenty of them in a rsrc11499, and there are never any other players there. The best place to kill ducks for rsrc375 is the rsrc1104 east of rsrc806, because there are several ducks and few players take advantage of the rsrc17822. You also can kill ducks and rsrc6071 north north-west of rsrc1461 close to the chicken coop. Aside from using rsrc498, players can usually only rsrc78 or rsrc59 them. Ranging ducks will cause you to lose your ammunition. Because of this, using Ranged to kill ducks is a method that is rarely used by most players. If the duck is next to the shore, the player can hit it with a rsrc507 rsrc16421, but this occurrence is rare, with the exception of the rsrc749 docks, where there are over 20 of them, and the small rsrc11499 in rsrc4193. There are also some ducks on the shore beside the rsrc806 Chicken Coop. In the rsrc1104, if rsrc15064 are following the duck you killed, they will say \"Eep!\" and swim away, most likely that it was their mother. However, soon after, the ducklings will find another \"mother\" and start following that duck, and if you kill that duck they will say \"Eep!\" again and find another duck to follow. At the area close to the chicken coop north-west of rsrc1461, when ducklings are following a duck and you kill the duck, the ducklings will say \"Cheep cheep!\" and then \"Eep!\""

It is the boss version of the rsrc253, found on the rsrc2865's rooftop. In order to access the roof, players must obtain a rsrc3535 from rsrc253 while assigned them for a rsrc16024. Similar to other slayer rsrc1708 such as rsrc2681 and the rsrc242, the Grotesque Guardians can only be killed while the player is assigned gargoyles as a rsrc16024. To initiate the fight, players must ring the Cloister Bell in the north side of the roof. This will trigger a cutscene in which the Guardians will awaken, and the fight will begin. Dusk is immune to magic and ranged attacks; only melee attacks will harm it. In addition, if players stand under Dusk, they will be trampled and receive 30-40 damage. Like gargoyles, players must bring a rsrc6629, rsrc8986 or a rsrc3534 to defeat Dusk. In the beginning of the fight, players must attack rsrc8987 with ranging attacks (as she cannot be harmed with melee and is resistant to magic), as Dusk cannot be harmed during this phase of the fight. Once her health has reached half, both will perform a lightning special attack that has an AoE of 3x3, rapidly dealing up to 5-7 damage per tick. After doing so, she will fly away, and players must attack Dusk. During this phase of the fight, Dusk's wings may glow, and will perform an explosive attack. If players do not run away from him when he does so, the player will be dealt 30+ damage and be knocked back. In addition, debris may fall around the roof, which can deal up to 10 damage and rsrc3080 players for a brief period of time. Once his health has reached half, Dusk will perform the lightning special attack once more with Dawn. After defeating Dawn, Dusk will absorb her essence, and initiate the final phase of the fight. Here, he is stronger, can use magic and ranged attacks, and may drag players to a prison of purple flames. Players must escape the prison (by clicking anywhere outside it), or they will be dealt 60+ damage, which heals Dusk. In addition to the 100% drop of rsrc4142, the player will also have two rolls on the rsrc426' drop table.  Upon release, Dusk had 600 hitpoints. This was reduced to 450 in rsrc16554 on 12 July rsrc231."

They are located in the rsrc8653 and the rsrc1323. The use of a rsrc6022 or a rsrc282 is required to fight dust devils as they use clouds of dust, sand, ash, and whatever else they can inhale to blind and disorient their victims. Dust devils cannot be assigned as a Slayer task until starting rsrc1336.rsrc274 Players need at least level 65 rsrc285 to fight these creatures. Protective headgear is also required to fight them; if players don't wear a rsrc6022, rsrc282 or rsrc286, they will not be able to damage dust devils, as a single attack from them unprotected will reduce rsrc28, rsrc64, rsrc78, and rsrc59 to 0 whilst halving a player's rsrc81 points. An effective method to kill dust devils in the rsrc1323 is to use rsrc10517 or rsrc2988. Turn on rsrc1264, then attack the dust devils with a fast ranged weapon (such as rsrc16474 or rsrc1695) to get them aggressive towards you. Run to a side which has two corners adjacent to each other and run back and forth between the two corners so that the dust devils clump into a small area. Switch to magic attack and use Ice Burst/Barrage. Since the dust devils have very little Magic defence, magical accuracy doesn't matter much, and players may choose to use equipment with high Prayer bonus to save rsrc1044 doses. Equipment that increases magic strength, such as a rsrc9556, rsrc1179, and rsrc57 are still worth bringing for their ability to increase your max hit. Additionally, having a rsrc3277 helps in this regard since burying bones inside the rsrc1323 also restores Prayer points. A good healing strategy is to use the spell rsrc3315 to maximise one's stay. Players with 80+ rsrc30 and a rsrc9228 shouldn't need much more than 5 sharks for a slayer task. However, those with high Defence and good defensive armour may not require any food, especially due to the occasional 4 rsrc4409 drop. If using Magic or Ranged in the rsrc8653, some of the lava pits can be used as rsrc16428. One of them is the lava pit located northwest of the door leading to the burnt chest. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550. "

    "article-text": "Earth warriors are a type of humanoid earth elemental found in a dirt-lined chamber in the rsrc3317. This area is in the rsrc464 so it is advised to come prepared for rsrc17826. Their chamber requires the player to climb across a set of monkey bars, which requires 15 rsrc505. It is recommended to bring rsrc184 and an emergency rsrc5544, as failing the monkey bars will damage the player. The chamber in which they are located, stretches from level 7 to level 10 Wilderness. Be careful of player killers who disguise themselves in full rsrc16393 to take on the appearance of Earth warriors. If you attack them, you will become rsrc265 because you are in the Wilderness, and can risk losing all of your items if you are not careful. This can easily be avoided, as the bronze armour worn by players is much darker than an Earth warrior's skin, and the feather on the helmet is purple. Non-disguised player killers frequently world hop at this area and spawn in at the edge of the small linking corridor, behind one of the stalagtites. When killing Earth Warriors keep a close eye on this area and have a plan for being attacked (e.g. Stay by the monkey bars to escape quickly when they spawn). Do not bring anything you can't afford to lose. Tip: To avoid accidentally attacking another player and getting skulled, go to rsrc17827, and click on \"Controls\" (joystick icon) and change \"Player 'Attack' options\" to either \"Always right-click\" or \"Hidden\". It is recommended to use rsrc5634 or rsrc59 as these are their weaknesses. This monsters drops seeds from the rsrc14052. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the rsrc16088."

The Earth wizard is seen wearing green robes, a green cape and wielding a rsrc1351. Upon engaging in combat, the Earth wizard's primary attack is rsrc864. If the player attacks with an rsrc10533, the wizard will heal. The Earth wizard is especially effective against melee as it can also cast rsrc3185.  Just like the other three wizards, the Earth wizard does not drop rsrc2071. Instead, it drops rsrc175 as 100% drop. This is strange given its human-like appearance. Earth wizards die the same way as the character in the Draynor Bank Robbery video, turning into a skeleton and then falling to the ground."

    "article-text": "Elder Chaos druids are high-level mages that are extremely dangerous compared to their low-level counterparts, the rsrc3710. Elder Chaos druids use rsrc845 which is fairly accurate if players are not properly equipped. They can also cast a teleportation spell that brings players within meleeing distance if the player tries to evade the battle (If there is multiple targets, even if they are attacking someone else they will attempt to teleport the person who is running that has done the most damage to them before others). The special closely resembles rsrc272. Elder Chaos druids are a popular place for rsrc1675 rsrc518. It is suggested to use rsrc5495 when killing these, otherwise they can be very dangerous and can kill you very quickly. Elder Chaos druids reside in the rsrc2829, 13 levels deep in the rsrc464. Because of the short distance from the rsrc5869 within the temple, players with 37 rsrc81 or higher often train on Elder Chaos druids while using the Protect from Magic prayer. Training on the druids requires little resources and is relatively safe, aside from the inherent dangers of being in the Wilderness. "

They are usually killed either as a rsrc16024  or to obtain rsrc5009 which grant quick teleportation to rsrc2017. To unlock them as a slayer task, the player must complete the rsrc495 quest. rsrc274 Elf warriors have high rsrc30 and utilise strong weaponry - the level 108 warriors use a rsrc4995 (which has the reach of a rsrc498 but the speed of a rsrc252), while the level 90 warriors use a rsrc794. It is recommended to use high rsrc81 boosting armour (e.g. rsrc6983) whilst activating the rsrc1264 prayer when killing them. Players that have access to rsrc2017 can easily recharge their Prayer at the nearby rsrc5869 when needed. Killing the elves in Lletya (which requires starting rsrc2239) is more convenient than killing those in the rsrc5756 as there is a nearby rsrc1074 and an rsrc5869 upstairs in the house where rsrc2888 is located. If the player has 43 rsrc81, rsrc7104 may be used while using the rsrc5869 on the second floor at rsrc2017 for rsrc81 restoration. The ladder is located north of the rsrc1074. Killing elves in Lletya requires starting rsrc2239. Some lower-levelled players may find that the safest method is to use rsrc78 or rsrc59 while using the west bench as a rsrc8361. Note that the fences cannot be used as safe spots, and that the west bench is the only safe spot in the area. Note also that the elf warriors using melee have the same reach as a halberd, and so rsrc498 should not be used by the player due to the fact that they are very slow.  There is also a safe spot at the entrance of Lletya, just beyond the bench. Upstairs there is a rsrc13715 run by rsrc13710, where the player can buy rsrc3504, rsrc1929, rsrc3395, rsrc1926, and rsrc2835. The shop stocks ten of each food item. Another alternative to complete this rsrc16024 is to kill the elves at the rsrc5756. The Elf Camp has a rsrc11733 and a rsrc17829 spot. Therefore, players can kill the elves there while supplying themselves with rsrc184 through rsrc508. At the Elf Camp the elves can be safe-spotted with Ranged or Magic by attacking the ones wielding a crystal halberd and using one of the several stools or spear-walls at the camp. The moss-covered rocks cannot be fired over and do not serve as rsrc17830. Another option available to those who have started the quest rsrc17831 is to kill the level 108 rsrc16812 in the rsrc9149 of the rsrc13445. As these mourners are considered elves, they count toward a player's Slayer task when killed. The level 108 mourners have lower defensive stats than ordinary Elf Warriors and so may be easier to kill. However, they do not drop seeds or rsrc9627. A rsrc3540 may be used to teleport the player to the nearby rsrc656. It may be a good idea to use the rsrc16162 spell here, due to there being frequent drops of rsrc1603, rsrc4691, and rsrc5706. Estimated drop rates are based off 1,000 kills.rsrc2761 Players have approximately a 14.5/128 chance of receiving a herb from this table. In addition to the drops above, this monster approximately has access to the rsrc16088. "

Elvarg was confirmed to be female in the 7 March 2007 rsrc17832, by such quotes as \"She wouldn't 'a had second thoughts about roasting yer with her breath\u2026 and That's what she done to Crandor, after all\u2026\" She can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete. An rsrc1391 is provided in the arena. Elvarg will always drop rsrc1939 when killed in the arena. Hard version will lower stats if you have insufficient rsrc1395 protection. An rsrc1391 must be equipped before fighting Elvarg. As Elvarg is weak to stab attacks, a rsrc586 is recommended as it possesses the highest stab bonus in F2P. A rsrc364, rsrc401 or rsrc9014 are effective. Good-quality armour is a must; preferably rsrc17700 or better. Foods such as rsrc1929 or better are optimal for fighting her."

He can be fought in the rsrc238 after the rsrc484 quest is complete. He can also be found in the rsrc2732 chicken coop, where he will respawn at a fixed rate. Before the random event update in 2014, Evil Chicken would immediately start attacking players upon arriving, using a rsrc59-based attack which is low-hitting but extremely accurate and rapid. This made him very dangerous for players who are low on rsrc65 or unattentive. Players were forced to either fight and kill the chicken or run away from it. If you managed to kill him, he dropped between 32-750 rsrc16349, rsrc935, and rsrc2071. The Evil Chicken could not be attacked by anyone besides the player to whom he appeared. If the player took too long to kill him, or if they were in range but not attackable (such as if they are in a different room), the Evil Chicken would get bored and leave. The chicken could not move from the spot in which he has appeared, so if a player stepped on top of him, instead of moving to the side as other monsters will, he would shout \"Get off of me!,\" and use a rsrc15915 which will push the player aside. The Evil Chicken's rsrc17837 used to vary depending on the player's combat level.  The examine text \"A Fowl Beast\" is a pun, as \"fowl\" means bird, and is a homophone of \"foul\" which means evil. The evil chicken spawns un-aggressively to players at the rsrc2732 near rsrc378. When a player attacks it, the chicken will attack the player and give the same attack dialogue."

They are accessed after the rsrc7840 is placed on the easternmost memorial with the indent on it and then pushed to reveal their dungeon. Due to having very high hit-points, low resistances to melee attacks and very weak attacks (rarely hitting above a 0), the level 25 experiments are popular for players wishing to train combat skills from 1-70. The level 51 experiment may only be killed during the rsrc1751 quest in order to obtain the rsrc4242. If the player already has a cavern key in their inventory or if it has been used on the gate, they can no longer attack this experiment and instead receive the message \"You don't have the heart to kill the poor creature again.\"  The half sheep half wolf experiment may refer to the saying A wolf in sheep's clothing. Or possibly 'sheep-dog'. The half man half spider is a reference to 'Spider-Man'. The half wolf and half woman is a reference to 'She-Wolf'."

Looking at the creature from side on you can see that it has the child's ball stuck to its head, from the rsrc2012 quest. Even after you finish the quest they still have them on their heads. When it attacks with rsrc78, it throws the rsrc8187 that it has in its arm on its head. Furthermore, a rsrc8187 may also appear below you when it attacks with range, similar to how when the player attacks an enemy with a Ranged attack, their ammunition will appear underneath it. If you go to the top of the rsrc3710 chamber in rsrc2922, you can see the Experiment."

Fareed possesses the unique ability to disarm players who are not wearing rsrc2678 when they are attacking him close up. Once Fareed is defeated, rsrc9585 is automatically added to the player's inventory. A message appears in the player's chatbox stating \"You take the Diamond of Smoke from the ashes of the warrior.\" He can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete. He seems to be immune to the Zapper power-up there. rsrc8653, gated area all the way east - the player must light the four torches in each corner of the dungeon, then open the burnt chest in the middle of the dungeon while the torches are still lit in order to get the key which unlocks the gate to Fareed's room. Fareed is resistant to rsrc507 while being weak to rsrc10543 and rsrc7042. He is immune to the damage of non-water spells and rsrc78 ammunition other than Ice arrows and rsrc4132 (rsrc984). Due to Fareed's disarming ability, it is advised players who lack the rsrc2678 to use Water spells as they do not require a weapon to be equipped. rsrc1264 is strongly advised if fighting Fareed close up as he can hit up to 40 with melee (this is lowered slightly to 36 if ice gloves are worn). He can also use a melee-distance rsrc59 attack which hits up to around 20. If Protect from Melee is used in conjunction with high Magic defence armour (rsrc3050/rsrc1126), Fareed will hit very little on the player. For players who cannot use Protect from Melee, the use of rsrc8122/rsrc8121 and attacking Fareed with their strongest Water spell from a distance is recommended. Players who opt to use Ranged must use Ice arrows as Fareed is immune to any other ammunition. Likewise, players who opt to use Magic must use Water spells to harm him. It is possible to kill Fareed without ice gloves while using Ranged or Magic (with a weapon) so long as the player keeps their distance from him. However, this is not possible for melee users as players who use melee will have their weapon unequipped since they are in close distance; using melee to kill him without ice gloves is NOT RECOMMENDED.  Fareed (\u0641\u0631\u064a\u062f) is an Arabic word and common male name that means \"unique\"."

Having rsrc2321 in your inventory greatly weakens vampyres. The feral vampyres found in the Haunted Woods and Abandoned Mine will occasionally bite players, which can sometimes drain stats and will cause the vampyre to recover a small amount of rsrc65. Feral vampyres also heal 1 hit point when attacked, similar to rsrc4297. The chance of this can be decreased by wearing a rsrc1082, but not entirely prevented. The level 72 feral vampyres are significantly harder to kill than the level 61 feral vampyres. They will only spawn when the spiders in the Haunted Woods are staring at players, so if you want to avoid them, stay away from the spiders. Additionally, held rsrc9002 and rsrc399 may sometimes be turned into feral vampyres when a rsrc1051 potion is used on them. These feral vampyres are not affected by garlic, and do not bite players to heal themselves. They also have no drops besides Vampyre dust. This monsters drops seeds from the rsrc14052. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550.  Prior to the release of rsrc2982 on 24 May rsrc231, they were simply called \"Vampire\". They now share a name with their rsrc17839. Juveniles and juvinates made feral were previously known as Angry vampyres.

Protection prayers are recommended; this monster can hit fairly hard for its level, and cannot be poisoned. This monster does not drop rsrc4348. These can only be obtained as a direct drop from rsrc1285, or by building a rsrc17851 with rsrc4346, which are also obtained from killing mithril dragons. Note: The Ferocious barbarian spirit will disappear if not defeated within a certain amount of time, even if still in combat. Lower levelled players should consider this if attempting to complete barbarian skills training as if the spirit is not defeated, it will not count towards the training and the player will have to gather the bones once more. There is a safespot when using the northern Pyre Sites, near the whirpool to the rsrc1289. Lure the spirit near the bridge and attack him while you are standing on the bridge and he is behind the fence. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550."

Players must wear rsrc9537 while fighting them, or face being damaged repeatedly and becoming rsrc17852. Fever spiders are considered to be a relatively fast task due to the large quantity of spiders and their low rsrc30. Players only need to wear slayer gloves if they are being hit by fever spiders, so players using rsrc78 or rsrc59 could wear a better handslot item and make use rsrc8361. A notable safespot is located in the south-west corner, where players can trap the spiders on the edges of crates. Players safe spotting the spiders without wearing slayer gloves are advised to bring a rsrc323 in case the player accidentally becomes diseased. They are notable for dropping only one variety of herb, rsrc6746."

They are also the strongest of the standard giants, being significantly stronger than their rsrc2489 and rsrc1322 relatives. Fire giants are assigned by a multitude of rsrc1956, providing fairly decent experience for both rsrc712 and Slayer. They're also frequently killed by rsrc17812 players early on due to their signature rsrc364 drop, as they are fairly easy to access with numerous rsrc16428. Although there are many locations where rsrc984 can be used, none of these locations are in a rsrc1675. In the rsrc169 and the rsrc3524, they may be attacked safely with rsrc78 or rsrc59. The Waterfall Dungeon is safest place to attack them from a range because of the safespot both behind the rock in the middle of the room and in the doorway, as the giants are too large (2 spaces wide) to retaliate. The Smoke Dungeon contains a few fire giants which are almost always empty as players are forced to bring a facemask or slayer helm to avoid smoke inhalation. There are no safespots in this location. The rsrc6117 has a safespot that can be used with little to no interruption from other aggressive fire giants. However, you may only kill monsters in this cave if they are currently assigned to you by a slayer master. However, in the rsrc1323, the best safespot of all becomes available after 10 minutes and grants complete protection against any attacks. Killing these in the rsrc1323 is often favoured if not planning to use a cannon (as they cannot be placed in the dungeon), as they grant higher slayer experience than normal and also drop rsrc1311 and rsrc4516 pieces. The rsrc6738 also contains fire giants; however, given its location deep in the rsrc464, it is usually only used for rsrc17854. If completing a task here, is recommended to complete the medium rsrc5711 to unlock a shortcut which significantly cuts travelling time and increases odds of escaping player killers. These items are dropped alongside the other items listed above. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the rsrc16088. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has a 1/128 chance to access the standard rsrc550. "

When a player attempts to open the door, he will appear and demand to know their identity. If the player chooses to identify themselves as a humble pilgrim, he will comment that no pilgrims have been to the temple for thousands of years, and will tell the player that the temple is closed. Otherwise, if the player instead states that they are a mighty hero, he will become enraged and attack. He is level 84, and can only be defeated with rsrc7042 that are collected in in the icy caverns within the temple. He uses fire-based rsrc59 attacks. If the player takes too long to kill him, he will simply disappear and the player will have to make him appear again. Once he has been defeated, he will no longer spawn and the door can be passed freely."

The fire wizard roams the area with his three elemental companions: rsrc896, rsrc10264, and rsrc5682. When engaged in combat, the fire wizard can cast rsrc17855 and rsrc3185. If the player attacks with any type of fire spell, the wizard will say, \"Gratias tibi ago\", and then heal himself.  Just like the other three wizards, the fire wizard does not drop rsrc2071, but instead rsrc175 as a 100% drop. This is strange given its human-like appearance. Fire wizards die the same way as the character in the Draynor Bank Robbery video, turning into a skeleton and then falling to the ground. \"Gr\u0101ti\u0101s tibi ag\u014d\" means \"I thank you\" in Latin."

He attacks using fairly strong rsrc507 attack and close-range rsrc59. Players are advised to wear rsrc2678 while fighting him as when he lands a hit on the player, if they are not wearing ice gloves, their weapon will be unequipped. Flambeed is weak to rsrc10543, rsrc507 attacks (especially crush) and rsrc7042. A popular way to defeat him is to use rsrc8122/rsrc8121 and proceed to cast rsrc831/rsrc842 while maintaining distance. A rsrc3225/rsrc1678 can also be used with Ice arrows in place of Water spells. This method works effectively if the player does not have ice gloves as they will hardly be under attack, alleviating Flambeed's ability to disarm the player. If melee is used, a strong crush weapon such as a rsrc1709 or rsrc275 is recommended as well as wearing ice gloves, since melee users will be constantly hit. It's rare but possible for him to spawn inside one of the portals. If this happens, he will be unable to move and players can safely attack him from a distance. He can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete."

Flesh crawlers drop rsrc1646 often, and are frequently killed for their uncommon rsrc5228 drops. It is recommended that players bring good food unless they have a rsrc30 level of at least 40. They are good for rsrc712 training of any kind at a medium-high level (35 - 85 combat). It's beneficial to have around 40 in whichever combat skills are being used. Focused players can make upwards of 150,000 coins per hour while receiving 20,000 \u2014 40,000 experience per hour. Good drops to pick up are any noted iron ores as well as rsrc2768 and Ranarrs. Flesh crawlers are aggressive to any level players. Range is a good strategy as there are rsrc8361 in the rooms. It is possible to hide behind nonaggressive rsrc4850 in one room and range the flesh crawlers, protected from their rapid, although weak, attacks. They attack with the speed of rsrc16474 set to rapid. Because these attacks max at 1 damage, the use of a rsrc2440 can help to offset much of the damage taken, especially if the player has a strong defence. For minimal user-input (also known as afk or semi-afk training), turn on auto retaliate and let the Flesh Crawlers come to you. When they lose their rsrc10710, simply move to another room, then come back. To reduce banking trips needed, deposit all non-stackable drops when you are teleported to rsrc3360, and drop all herbs aside from Ranarr, as Ranarrs are often more valuable than even their highest levelled herbs such as rsrc5625. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550. "

During rsrc2230, players need to either talk to him or kill him to get the rsrc7121. His rsrc173 is 23. If the player decides to talk to him, he will ask three questions to which players must answer correctly to proceed. Q. How is Glough's wife? Q. What is Glough's favourite food? Q. What is his new girlfriend's name?  His combat sounds and death cry are those of a rsrc172. His rsrc17235 time is very fast, due to him being a rsrc15898 rsrc15930, and thus players need to talk to him, which could be hard if someone continually killed him and he took a while to respawn. He gives an unusually small amount of combat experience when fighting."

He attempted to launch a final ball of rsrc1395 at the player, but collapsed before he was able to do so, incinerating his creator instead. The main fight takes place in an rsrc11750; if the player dies battling Galvek, they can pay 100,000 coins to rsrc5491 to reclaim their items. If players die elsewhere, these items will be lost. In addition to this, Torfinn's holding capabilities do not stack with others (e.g rsrc688, rsrc426), so if players have items being held by one of these fights and dies to Galvek, the items there will be lost. After the quest, players can fight Galvek again through the rsrc13946 in the rsrc3068. Deaths here are considered safe. Galvek has 1,200 health and four phases, with each phase consisting of 300 rsrc65 each. He uses all three forms of rsrc712, and a special rsrc1395 attack which is capable of killing players in one hit if they do not move away from it, regardless of their protection. If next to the tile, which was hit by dragonfire, players take half the damage instead. The effects of rsrc4984 do not work against Galvek. He can also launch pink dragonfire, which disables all prayers upon impact. Galvek stands at the bow of the ship, attacking players with rsrc507 and rsrc59. He can occasionally launch fire bombs, which if touched (bombs cover a 3x3 radius), will deal an incredible amount of damage, and will very likely instantly kill the player. These fire bombs are always placed in the same position, and will explode after a set amount of time has passed. This phase is common to die in due to players trying to move to avoid his rsrc1395 attack or moving at the same time Galvek teleports them, resulting in the player running into a bomb and dying. Galvek takes on the powers of air, flying towards the western side of the ship. He can occasionally launch gusts of wind that drain the player's stats by 2 and run energy by 40%. Galvek also begins to use rsrc78 attacks here and uses his Ranged and rsrc59 attacks at random. Galvek takes on the powers of water, flying towards the eastern side of the ship. He can occasionally send out tsunami waves (acting much like the rsrc17057 firewalls in RuneScape 3) along with the standard one-hit fireball. If hit by these waves, the player will take damage equal to their health. Phase III has the potential to be Galvek's deadliest phase, as the player is incredibly limited to movement if Galvek launches his tsunami and his fireball subsequently, leaving almost no room for error. Galvek also uses rsrc78 attacks much more commonly in this phase. Galvek takes on the powers of earth, landing on the middle of the ship. He can occasionally launch earth projectiles, which if the player is caught in, will be bound for several seconds. This deals no actual damage to the player, but leaves them extremely vulnerable to the highly damaging rsrc1395, which he almost always uses if he is successful in binding the player. His earth attack can be avoided by simply moving one square. Moreover, walking in circles around Galvek allows the player to avoid his rocks and dragonfire. "

Gargoyles, like rsrc1957, cannot be killed normally. In order to kill a gargoyle, a rsrc6629 (or a rsrc8986) must be used when they reach 9 or lower rsrc65. This can be very click intensive and is not always preferred; fortunately, you can buy the \"Gargoyle Smasher\" perk from the Slayer store (requiring 120 rsrc16865), which will automatically smash the gargoyle when it falls to 9 or lower Hitpoints (you still must have the rock hammer in your inventory for this to work). Because of the number of rsrc17858 drops, it is recommended to bring rsrc8 runes to reduce the frequency of banking and save inventory space. Gargoyles can be rsrc17724 near the doorway in the south-west area at the top floor in Slayer Tower or in the north-east corner of the basement behind an immovable bucket on the floor.

She is the equivalent to the rsrc11753 from the rsrc2221 quest, although Gelatinnoth Mother will switch colours after a certain amount of damage/hits is dealt. She will turn different colours every 15 to 20 seconds, not counting damage/hits dealt in the current colour, and her colour shows her weakness to a certain type of rsrc59 spell or attack. The Gelatinnoth Mother is fight-able as a boss monster in the rsrc238 minigame if the player has completed Recipe for Disaster. The following table shows her colours in the order she cycles through them in the rsrc16521 subquest and lists which attacks she is weak against in each state. You can safe spot the Gelatinnoth Mother at the corner of the arena and wait until the colour of your choosing to attack her. Players are faced with a dilemma on this monster, as they must defend against both melee and ranged attacks without using rsrc81, but be able to attack most of the time using magic. The challenge is to find a mix of armour that provides sufficient defence without imposing undue attack penalties. A good set of armour is rsrc792 with an rsrc17859 and an rsrc6636, as this gives players a respectable mage attack bonus (which players need two-thirds of the time) and also allows players to have a balanced defence against the mother's attacks. Using high class melee armour such as rsrc16290 even while using spells at 65+ Magic still works perfectly fine, as long as players use attacks to which the Mother is currently weak and which negate virtually all of her ranged damage throughout the encounter. (Players should still bring some high-healing rsrc184, however, for her melee.) Tested success rate with spells using this armour at level 68 Magic was roughly 80% when using the appropriate elemental spell. Another great way to get through this fight is with rsrc5471. You can cycle through powerful melee, magic, and ranged armour by exchanging the helms. The armour also gives a good defence against all types of attacks. A slightly less exotic armour mix that works is a mage top and bottom (such as rsrc5083, rsrc16070, or rsrc7402), a rsrc4545 or rsrc17860, and a rsrc1260. This combination still has a significant ranged attack penalty, but players can wait until the Mother switches vulnerabilities to begin attacking again. If a player has 70 Ranged and 60 rsrc30, it's quite easy to maximise range and mage defensive bonuses. Using a combination of a rsrc11009, rsrc110, rsrc4640, rsrc809, rsrc4208, rsrc2260 and an rsrc1075, as this provides decent mage attack bonus, and very good all around defensive bonuses. "

    "article-text": "General Graardor is the leader of rsrc1273' forces within the rsrc467. He is the only known living member of the rsrc13259 race in rsrc16461. He is found in Bandos' Stronghold, which requires a rsrc64 level of 70 and a rsrc422 to access. To enter his quarters, players must have killed 40 of Bandos' followers throughout the dungeon, with rsrc873 being the easiest of the followers to kill. Like other God Wars Dungeon bosses, Graardor roams around a rectangular room with his bodyguards until a player enters, attacking them on sight. He attacks primarily with melee, and his bodyguards use a different combat style each. Graardor may also use a ranged attack where he slams the ground. If all players leave, his health and stats will be reset. General Graardor will yell out the following whether or not he is in combat with any players: In addition to the drops above, this monster  has a 8/127 chance to access the standard rsrc550.  At Old School RuneScape's first rsrc124, players could speak to General Graardor, resulting in the following dialogue: Player: Erm.... hi? Graardor: Puny 'uman ffffedddfded meeee Player: Yeah right okay there's no point taking this further. Graardor eats a nearby ankou. Player: Erm.... hi? Graardor: Puny 'uman ffffedddfded meeee Player: Yeah right okay there's no point taking this further. Graardor eats a nearby ankou. At Old School RuneScape's fifth birthday event, a very large statue of General Graardor was present. Prior to the 19 January 2017 update, Graardor had a Magic level of 280; this was reduced to 80 in order to prevent the rsrc1671 from dealing massive damage on him, and to compensate for the decreased Magic level, his magic defence bonus was increased from +65 to +201. However, this ultimately resulted in Graardor being much easier to kill with magic attacks, and a hotfix was applied the following day in order to rebalance his magic resistance. Although he is the last living Ourg, General Graardor does not drop rsrc3290. Any rsrc671, most notably the rsrc2134, can be used in lieu of a regular hammer when entering Bandos' Stronghold."

His followers believe that he is an undead maniac who died over 200 years ago, but he is an actuality a rsrc1220 rsrc9686. He has established a large territory between rsrc23 and rsrc1632 and is at war with the rsrc172. He may be fought after killing rsrc9341, his pet rsrc1326 and only friend, though it is not required. He is spoken to frequently during rsrc4638 rsrc1372. General Khazard is the owner of the rsrc7395 and the one who ordered his men to invade the rsrc222. During the rsrc7382 rsrc132, he kidnaps members of rich families, such as rsrc14141's rsrc7397 and rsrc14142, and forces them to fight for their lives at his arena for the entertainment of citizens of Khazard. However, during the quest, he makes a bet with the player, and if the player beats all his monsters, he sets all his fight slaves free. The hero defeats all of Khazard's monsters, and an angry Khazard sets his pet rsrc1326, rsrc9341, on him. The player kills Bouncer, and an enraged Khazard attempts to kill the player, only to be defeated in combat. He survives and later appears in rsrc4638 rsrc1372. After the quest, he can be found on the second floor of the Fight Arena building, and may be fought if he was not defeated during the quest. Khazard is also featured during rsrc4638 rsrc1372. In it, the player meets Khazard's ghost in the Fremennik Forest. The General appears to have forgotten the player's role in his defeat, as he charges him/her with speaking to several messengers scattered across rsrc3096. After this is done, Khazard tells the player to visit the rsrc10727 near the rsrc749 for his/her reward. The \"reward\", however, is a lie, as the General does indeed remember the player's name, and sets a trap for him/her. Upon entering the cave, the player is ambushed by the spectre of the General's pet, rsrc9348. This is not his true form, and he probably thinks other rsrc9686 are weak themselves, as he refers to \"them\" as cunning, not strong. He has some influence in the ghost world, as he was able to send some of his scouts to spy on human strongholds.  General Khazard seems to wield an rsrc7129 with one hand, yet attacks with two. Similar to rsrc3738's case, who wields a rsrc4640 and a rsrc2629 with both hands. General Khazard seems to wield an iron 2h sword, but he has the same rsrc73 as a rsrc633, which has an attack speed of 6. General Khazard's face appeared as a skull, just like many other of his fellow rsrc9686."

When they first appear they are invisible and have no rsrc173, and try to turn food into useless rsrc5588; if players have no food they will do damage instead. Ghasts can only be killed after completion of the rsrc217 quest. You must have a rsrc5587 and rsrc17864 to kill them. You must use the ability of the blessed silver sickle near some dead logs or bushes to harvest rsrc16556, rsrc5793, or rsrc17865 then put those into a druid pouch by filling it. When your druid pouch has been filled, you can use it to make a Ghast visible, or wait until a Ghast attacks you to make it visible. This renders the Ghast vulnerable to attack; killing it rewards the player with 30 rsrc81 experience. Due to the nature of making the Ghasts visible, they are not good for rsrc712 training. They do drop lots of rsrc16793, but so do rsrc17866. The material drops are pretty weak as well. You do, however, gain reasonable Prayer XP as well as Combat XP for killing them. The best place to hunt them would be just west of the rsrc4604 from the rsrc217 quest. This allows you to keep refreshing your rsrc16116 without using valuable rsrc16466. The silver sickle does not have to actually be equipped to gain its benefits, it just has to be in your inventory. A player can use whichever weapon they choose for combat, not having to use the sickle. Fully charge your prayer points, go west of the Grotto (where the Ghasts are) and cast rsrc218 with the sickle next to the rotten logs.  Try and do it between 2 logs, and you will occasionally get 2 mushrooms to put in the rsrc5587. Do this over and over until you are out of prayer points. Now \"use\" the filled pouch on the ghostly Ghasts - do not wait for them to attack you. Often they will just float around, or the pouch will activate itself, allowing the solid Ghast to float out over the water where it cannot be attacked. The drops will more often than not fall under the rotten logs, so search the ground carefully after defeating the Ghast. You can actually fill the druid pouch much faster if you cast bloom near fallen tree branches, their trimmings count for 2 in your druid pouch as opposed to mushrooms only counting for one charge. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the rsrc16088. "

The level 99 variants are the toughest monster in the dungeon. They are found to the south of the cave system, just outside the entrance to rsrc7747's rsrc9212. Their low rsrc30 combined with their high number of rsrc65 makes them a useful yet rarely used training monster, probably because of the need for a rsrc15946. Their frequent drops of rsrc17870 and rsrc6419, which can be sold to rsrc2305 in the rsrc1530 for 1,000 rsrc321 a piece, when combined to their closeness to the rsrc1461 and rsrc483 banks, can also make training fairly profitable.

    "article-text": "The Giant Mole (Talpidae wysonian) is a rsrc1708 found in the rsrc12216, just under rsrc4193. The Giant Mole's origin and creation are described as \"a slight accident involving a bottle of Malignius-Mortifer's-Super-Ultra-Flora-Growth-Potion\". The Giant Mole is located in the rsrc12216 beneath rsrc4193. A rsrc3354 is required to enter its lair. A rsrc15946 is also needed to be able to see in the dark tunnels. A rsrc3878 is highly recommended, as any light source that is not protected will extinguish, and the rsrc4126 will rarely break, with the candle disappearing, if he retreats within rsrc507 range. If you are using an unprotected light source such as a rsrc2048, you will need a rsrc470 to reignite it. If you have achieved 99 rsrc317, you can also bring the rsrc6111 either equipped or in your inventory, as it will act as a lightsource that cannot extinguish. When using the rsrc2451 or other rsrc17871 weapons, the mole will have a chance to be inflicted with regular rsrc296. The Giant Mole cannot be inflicted with venom. The most common method of killing the Giant Mole is with rsrc1124 and 1 health (often achieved by guzzling a rsrc236), as well as having the rsrc1264 prayer active to avoid taking any damage. This results in higher hits that decrease the time it takes to kill it significantly. The alternative to this low health method, for those uncomfortable with rsrc712 at low health (e.g. rsrc17872), is using your best rsrc305 rsrc17873, or rsrc17748 rsrc17874 with a rsrc1671, the latter of which is the fastest method of killing it. Having the rsrc6034 completed is recommended, as it will provide you with the rsrc6033. This shield will also work as a locator to the mole's whereabouts by a flashing red arrow on the minimap as long it is alive. The Falador Hard Diary reward will also make the rsrc17875 and rsrc2572 to be dropped in rsrc17834 form. The Giant Mole occasionally (around 100 health) digs himself underground, to resurface elsewhere within the lair. Since you will be running a lot, it is highly recommended to bring a fair amount of rsrc17876 or rsrc1045. Its rsrc17235 time is 10 seconds. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the standard rsrc550."

    "article-text": "Normal Hard                                                 The Giant Roc is a large avian monster encountered during the rsrc15898 rsrc3979. It can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete. It uses both rsrc507 and rsrc78 rsrc28, which hit up to 14 and 20 hitpoints respectively. Players are highly recommended to activate the rsrc81 rsrc3014 when fighting this creature. rsrc6599 will also attack the bird, but his attacks only tend to hit 1 to 3, so the player should not rely on this. Players should beware, as this monster can easily kill those who come unprepared. A one-click teleport is highly recommended. During battle, the Giant Roc will frequently buffet the player with its wings, knocking them backwards and damaging and rsrc3080 them for a short time. This can be countered by standing against a rock or wall, but the attack will still stun. The Roc only has defence against magic, so a melee or ranged weapon is suggested. Players can usually only land a few hits on the Roc before it blows them back, making it fairly hard to fight. If players do not wish to melee the Roc up close, then they can try ranging the Roc with their backs to the wall or behind the farming patch. The Giant Roc will destroy a rsrc984 if a player uses one. There is a safepot for mages and rangers on the far end of the mountainside, where the ladder is. By positioning yourself correctly, the Roc's massive size will make it unable to pass the torch that is between it and the ladder, meaning that it cannot come close enough to melee you. Combine this with protect from missiles and the only thing you have to worry about is the Roc's buffeting wings, making this fight not nearly as difficult as usual. Pure/Low defence/No protection prayers tactic: Hide yourself behind the goutweed to protect yourself from the Giant Roc's melee attack. Similarly, the small rocky outcrop next to the goutweed is a total safezone if you need to heal etc. The Roc's ranged attack is dodgeable, but requires a good rhythm which is messed up every time the Roc pushes you around. Just keep strafing forwards and backwards every time in between the ranged attacks (with run on) and shoot twice in between strafes with a shortbow, or cast one spell. This will make the Roc's rocks fall behind you, which makes you not take any damage whatsover. The buffeting wings will still damage you however, so remember to eat whenever necessary (best to eat while stunned since you can't move anyway).  The Giant Roc is the RuneScape counterpart to the legendary Persian bird, the rsrc17877. The Persian Roc was said to be able to carry elephants off into the sky, only to drop and eat them later. The Roc has a small chance to drop a rsrc3286 either during the quest or when facing it later in the Nightmare Zone."

When approached, they attack, unless they have become rsrc10710, in which case they remain as \"boulders\" - attempting to cast a spell on them gives the message \"You can't attack this NPC.\" Giant rock crabs are only initially aggressive if they are approached while dormant. Once they are moving and the targeted player is out of range, they stop being aggressive and will ignore players that don't attack them. They eventually become dormant boulders again after a while if they are not attacked. The giant rock crab is one of few monsters in RuneScape that will rsrc13553 from battle when they become critically wounded. This can be troublesome, as they are found in a single-way combat area. This can be prevented by attacking them while their back is turned to a nearby wall, so that they move away from the player and back up into the wall. If they move too far away, the player will follow them and risk being attacked by another rock crab. There are several protruding sections of the walls in the area that can be used as safespots which are ideal as the crabs' main weakness is magic.

It summons level 68 rsrc4904 and rsrc4892 to aid it in battle. The scarab is the sixth-highest level quest only monster that is fought via conventional means in the game. It can hit around 20 hitpoints with rsrc507 and rsrc78 and is very rsrc296, with the poison damage starting at 9. If the player is out of melee distance from the scarab and has rsrc3014 active, a message will appear in the player's chatbox \"The scarab clacks its mandibles and you are mystically poisoned\", inflicting them with poison. The grey object in its back is rsrc8495's rsrc6342 dagger. It can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete. Unlike the quest battle, the player can use rsrc6342 there. Throughout the fight, the scarab will summon minions to aid it, which will use a random attack style, and the player is likely to be affected by multiple attack styles at once. Players fighting the scarab up close should activate rsrc1264, while players attacking from afar should activate Protect from Missiles. The scarab is resistant to melee, although weaker to stab than any other melee style, so a rsrc5525 is recommended over an rsrc252. Using rsrc1125 and the Spike attack style is also a good idea due to the high melee/Ranged defence bonuses the set provides, and the rsrc1673 being able to ignore the scarab's Defence, as well as taking advantage of its stab weakness. The scarab also has fairly low Magic defence, so a rsrc1354/rsrc1361 or rsrc1352 is ideal if using rsrc59, with good Magic armour worn such as rsrc4666. However, players with 60+ ranged should have no problem killing it in up to 2 minutes. Use the best crossbow you can, for lower level range pures, bring Ruby bolts (e), higher levels should consider using the rsrc1695. During the quest, the scarab is immune to poison (though not in Nightmare Zone). Players using Ranged or Magic should run to the south-west corner of the room with Protect from Missiles active, mitigating the melee-using rsrc4904 as they will be unable to reach the player and only taking damage from rsrc4892. Otherwise do the same at the lake to the north. Warning: If the player dies during the fight, there is absolutely no way to retrieve items lost on rsrc2672! Should the player need to leave, they can either teleport out or run to the ladder and navigate the maze to escape. "

    "article-text": "The Giant Sea Snake is encountered at the end of the rsrc2361 quest. It is not as strong as its combat level suggests, but an rsrc17879, preferably rsrc17880, is vital, as the snake is poisonous with damage that starts at 9. It fights with rsrc507 up close and rsrc78 from a distance, but it cannot detect the use of rsrc81. Like its rsrc453, it is vulnerable to rsrc59. It drops the rsrc5798 which is needed to finish the quest, and it can only be fought once. Level 40 rsrc285 is required to kill this creature. The best way to defeat the snake is to attack it up close with magic to exploit its weakness. This way, it will not use its ranged attack, so players can freely use rsrc1264 to reduce the majority of the damage. Other factors such as what food to bring and what armour and weapon to use are left to the player's decision. It is recommended to bring at least rsrc1929 or rsrc1204. A rsrc984 can be setup in this area. "

They have two graphical versions, one with a rsrc658 and rsrc663, and the other with a round rsrc15904 and rsrc3514. These skeletons are found in the rsrc4585. Level 80 giant skeletons can be found in the Shadow Dungeon, which can be accessed using a rsrc6452 at a certain point during the rsrc1336 rsrc15898. They are similar to the giant skeleton found in rsrc2797, but differ in some ways, such as their examine text and their drops. The rsrc4585 giant skeletons (level 80) are good for semi-high levels to train on. Bringing rsrc17673 or even rsrc184 to heal make them good experience. rsrc825 is a powerful spell against skeletons and other rsrc277 for rsrc16397. Also, if you have the rsrc1086, you get 15% rsrc28 and rsrc64 bonuses, which makes killing these very efficient if using rsrc507. To effectively maximise your training experience if Melee'ing, either stand in the centre of the south-west area by the entrance, or run eastward past the first corridor (past the second batch of giant skeletons) and go north into the nook and stand in the middle. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550.  The level 45 rsrc1328 in rsrc4775's lair are the same size as giant skeletons, despite being \"normal\"."

He has a rsrc173 of 138. Glod has the ability to bellow threats at players to either make them run in fear of the huge giant or charge at him in anger. He can also heal himself similar to the gorillas on Ape Atoll, making him a bit harder to kill. When Glod is killed he drops the golden goblin which is a quest item needed for the rsrc4774 quest. Glod is immune to poison-based attacks. In addition, he also has the ability to disable any active rsrc81 on the player, also lowering their prayer points by a noticeable amount. However, this does not work like a rsrc639's special attack, which prevents players from using protection prayers for five seconds. If you stand at least 3 steps away from him, he will not be able to use his melee attacks. A good method of fighting Glod is with magic, standing at the edge of the arena as to render his bellow that makes players run away useless. Players will then only have to worry about the bellow that makes them charge forward. Alternatively, using melee with Protect from Melee will negate damage from his attacks. He can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete.  Upon release, Glod could be fought an infinite amount of times. This was changed by an update. Glod is an alternate name for Fornj\u00f3t, an ancient giant in Norse mythology. While fighting, Glod may shout \"Glod smash!\" and \"Glod angry! You wouldn't like Glod when angry!\" These are both a reference to the Marvel Comics hero, the Incredible Hulk, who says \"Hulk smash!\" and \"You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.\" Glod's appearance is really similar to that of the Incredible Hulk. It might be possible that Glod's design was based on the Incredible Hulk. Glod is one of the few NPCs that actually has visible fingers. Glod was featured as the first question in the RuneScape quiz 14. This quiz was released 29 June 2010, the question being \"Where can Glod be found?\" The answer was \"At the top of a beanstalk like all good giants!\" Glod is currently the largest giant in the game. The golden goblin is a reference to the golden hen and the golden harp from the fairy tale: \"Jack and the Beanstalk.\" The giant being found at the top of a beanstalk (and someone murdering the giant and stealing his possessions) is also a reference to Jack and the Beanstalk."

Glough's schemes are thwarted in The Grand Tree quest, and once again in rsrc47. He used to be the head tree guardian of the rsrc1530. He makes his first unsuccessful attempt on the player's life when he summons a rsrc843 to kill them in The Grand Tree, and again in Monkey Madness when it is discovered he has another \"pet\", the rsrc16802, that he uses to further his schemes, which is destroyed by the 10th Squad. During rsrc554, the player manages to break the alliance between Glough and the rsrc17077 by sabotaging rsrc8052 forces, along with his alliance between the ogres and trolls. Becoming increasingly deranged and desperate, Glough launches an attack on the rsrc370 by himself. He eventually meets his end at the hands of the player after a great skirmish, but not before killing rsrc5775. rsrc6482 sends the player on a mission to discover why the Grand Tree is dying. Little do they know that the wheels of Glough's dreams of world domination and hatred of rsrc16681 have been put in motion, he is in the process of preparing an armada of warships to strike at the heart of the human kingdoms. In The Grand Tree, players discover that Glough has hired a man named Charlie to steal the rsrc5079\u2014magic stones kept by one of the original creators of the Grand Tree, rsrc2232, that can be used to wound and even kill the Grand Tree\u2014so that he can frame him as the one who is responsible for the dying Grand Tree. Glough has used these rocks on the roots of the Grand Tree to wound it. In framing Charlie, he attempts to convince King Narnode that humans are trying to destroy the Grand Tree, which the King initially believes. The player eventually finds evidence of Glough's culpability in these plans and discovers that Glough has contracted workers to construct large warships in a distant rsrc4591 to invade the human territories and attempt to control the world. After presenting this evidence to the King and following an investigation of Glough's estate by the King's subjects, the King explains that all they found were a couple of sticks. When the player deciphers the meaning of these sticks and takes them to their intended area, the player finds themselves entrapped by Glough who sets a rsrc843 on them. The player kills the Demon and finds King Narnode at the end of the passage with his troop inspecting the roots and finding the rocks. Under the weight of all of this evidence, King Narnode has Glough placed under house arrest and the player is rewarded for their work. Meanwhile, an angry Glough plots his revenge against the player. King Narnode sends the player to investigate the disappearance of the elite 10th squad, who were tasked with decommissioning the Shipyard where Glough was preparing an armada to attack mankind. It turns out that the 10th Squad crashed on a small island south of Karamja due to powerful winds that damaged their gliders. When most of the squad leaves the island to inspect a nearby atoll that had been spotted prior to the crash, several of them are captured by sentient apes who imprison them. Some of the 10th squad escape. Two conduct espionage while three others work on carrying out a rescue operation for those captured. When rsrc1525 gives the player a puzzle box to solve, the player can alternatively bring it to Glough to have him solve it for them. However, Glough will charge the player 200,000 coins before nearly completing the puzzle for them. The player can ask why he will not complete the puzzle, and he will tell them that it would set off an alarm. In Monkey Madness, players discover that rsrc12453 is continuing Glough's plans for warfare with the humans, in the apparent absence of a confined Glough. rsrc16068, the leader of the apes, is eventually found to be conspiring with Glough's henchmen to attack mankind. By utilizing a technological breakthrough privy only to Glough and his circle, they will be able to teleport all of the 10th squad to an arena with an enormous Jungle Demon to have them killed off. Fortunately, the squad commander, Sergeant Garkor, learns of their intent before they act on it, and with a bit of ingenuity, enables the player to teleport with the 10th squad when it happens. The demon is defeated, and it appears that Caranock's and Awowogei's plans are foiled for the time being. After Monkey Madness, Glough can still be found in his treehouse, and when spoken to, says, \"Mark my words, the monkeys are listening\". This is a hint towards the rsrc554 quest. Glough mysteriously disappears from his house arrest, which prompts King Narnode to send the player to find out what he is plotting. It is shown that rsrc11376 had smuggled him out of house arrest and dropped him off at Ape Atoll. Glough has been experimenting with the monkeys and gorillas of Ape Atoll with an unknown mutagen. rsrc8052 was unaware of this, and had simply labelled it as Kruk's \"secret weapon\". When the player arrives on Glough's barge, Glough tells them (as Kruk) to send the remaining three rsrc2036 back into their cages, as they had broken out. After the gorillas are thrown back into the cage, Glough tells them that the mutagen is almost perfect, and that he is aiming to create a mutagen that makes the applicant more aggressive, but obedient to the controller. He leaves the player to find Le Smith; the player quickly sabotages the onyx charging the mutagen. After finding Le Smith, Glough hears about the monkeys backing off their attack. Despite this, he still continues onward. While on the Barge, the tormented gorillas break out and crash the ship. Glough manages to survive the crash and takes his best \"experiments\" into the cavern. When the player and Nieve arrive, Glough realises that the player had been foiling his plans all along, and sends his two tortured and rsrc2041 at them; however, the player and Nieve are able to defeat them. Glough becomes angered and drinks the remaining mutagen to finish off the player and Nieve. Nieve attempts to stop Glough, but the mutated Glough slams her into a wall and stomps the ground, causing a boulder to crash and kill Nieve. After a very long battle between the mutated Glough and the player, Glough is eventually defeated. However, the caverns become increasingly unstable due to Glough's actions and collapse, presumably killing him. After the quest, Glough can be refought for challenge purposes by gazing into the burning brazier in rsrc2379's house in western Gnome Stronghold. This fight will record the fastest kill time, and offers no rewards. Glough is mentioned in Gnomish language on rsrc1291 page 13. \"Laufata ki Glough ki Ta Quir Priw Undo eso, Tolly, gnomo kar is Glough hamo sarko pro rsrc10745 Qua!\" It has been partially translated as follows with the rsrc2231: \"The eye of Glough of The Guardian Tree Land for, the idiot, no gnome but Glough has begone to become the Stone City Guardian!\" "

Note that after completing the easy set of the rsrc17886, the desert horn will always be dropped as a note rather than the actual item. Since 'Billy' goats, the male of species, are a different creature, all 'goats' are doe or nannies, the females.

Goraks roll the rsrc550 frequently; it is suggested to bring a rsrc6373 as they drop uncut gems extremely commonly. It is one of the best monsters to kill for the rsrc5528 with a drop rate of around 1 in 250 (while wearing a rsrc4309) in the rsrc9422 while having rsrc192 completedrsrc274. The drop rate is further increased if rsrc4587 has been completed.rsrc2761 Goraks use typeless melee, which means that rsrc1264 will not prevent or reduce damage. For every rsrc813 they make, a random stat of the player will be drained by one (except rsrc65). As such, rsrc4920 with high crush defensive bonuses is recommended. If a gorak successfully hits the player while any rsrc16953 is active, a message will appear in their chatbox saying \"Your protection prayer doesn't seem to work!\" Several rsrc16428 are available in the Gorak Plane, although due to the high aggressive radius of goraks they may be difficult to use. One safespotting tactic is to use the southern walls of the inner ring, as they will get caught on the edges. If one attacks you from the south after respawning, run east/west until it can get caught on a corner, and then run back to the safe spot. The Gorak drop table is very unusual. Goraks in the Gorak Plane have access to two different drop tables. Goraks in the Gorak Plane usually drop from the Gorak Plane Drop Table. However, if the player is in the middle of doing an uninterruptable action such as eating food or using the rsrc789 spell, the Gorak will drop from the standard Gorak drop table instead. Other Goraks drop the standard Gorak drop table. Drop rates based off a sample of 512 kills. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has a 1/1 chance to access the rsrc16088.  In addition to the drops above, this monster  has a 5/128 chance to access the rsrc16088.   Goraks were formerly assigned for a rsrc3482 by rsrc7309 once players were able to access them during rsrc4587. They were removed from Duradel's task list in rsrc17890 on 10 September rsrc240. Despite this, Goraks are still shown as rsrc16572 when casting rsrc7925 on them."

    "article-text": "The Great Olm is the final rsrc1708 in the rsrc1178 raid. A large white salamander, it is one of rsrc5146's greatest possessions. Throughout the fight, Olm can also use these moves. If the left hand is clenched, these attacks will not occur: Olm also has phase-unique attacks: There are also attacks applied during other segments of the fight: Olm has at least three phases (more depending on the size of the party), with each successive phase granting Olm extra attacks (he can still use special attacks from old powers at any time as long as they have been accessed). You can resupply yourself if you die fighting it. Note that in order to attack, Olm must find a player in the direction that it is facing. If no targets are in that direction, Olm will move his head to where a player is, and will also skip one attack in its attack pattern. If the player is both experienced and fast enough, they can keep Olm from attacking them. This only applies to solo players as it is hard to coordinate in a group. To progress, disable both arms. They do not have to be disabled at the same time until the penultimate phase. Under no circumstances should you target the head until the start of the penultimate phase, as it has a healing aura that recovers any damage it takes. On the penultimate phase (3 + 1 more for every 8 players on the team), both arms must be permanently disabled quickly. If one arm is disabled and too much time passes before the other arm is disabled, Olm will regain control of that arm, and it will return with full health. The left arm will start using a rejuvenation aura after the teleport attack has been completed (symbolised as the infinite symbol), during which all damage will heal it instead. Once both arms are disabled, the final phase begins. Olm's head will remain, and it will attempt to kill the team in a final stand. It will use all attacks from the preceding phases, in addition to crystals falling from the ceiling. Olm also has the ability to siphon the team's rsrc65 during this phase. If your team can damage Olm quickly, this attack can be ignored as there will still be crystals falling from above which can deal a lot of damage. Finish Olm off, and claim your rewards once it dies. Olm's left hand (on the right side when facing Olm) is the hand which should be disabled with rsrc507. This hand is also the hand that indicates which move is coming next out of crystals, lightning wall and teleport attack. At first, the next attack may seem random, but each phase does the moves in a set order. This may change between each raid but so far these are the expected rotations. An rsrc17891 is a species of aquatic serpentine salamanders living in lakes deep underground. Olm made a teaser appearance on the rsrc2315, where it killed a worker named rsrc3037 in a future vision. The Great Olm is the only monster in the Chambers of Xeric that has a defined combat level; all other monsters encountered inside do not have any known combat level. In addition, its arms also have a defined combat level (though they are still part of it, so it is still technically one monster). Interestingly enough, the left arm boasts a higher combat level than the right arm.

    "article-text": "The Greater abyssal demon is a rsrc17669 variant of the normal rsrc272. It has a chance of spawning after purchasing the unlock Bigger and Badder for 150 rsrc293 from any rsrc1956. The greater abyssal demon has a special attack, like other high levelled superior slayer monsters. The greater abyssal demon will teleport around the player, hitting them quickly at an attack speed of 8 or 9 for the next four hits (one hit per teleport). This special attack seems to have 100% accuracy, so rsrc1264 is advised for the whole fight as it occurs at random intervals and often hits very hard. Like all demons, the greater abyssal demon is weak against the rsrc2789, rsrc1321 and rsrc1324. Superior slayer monsters give 3 rolls on their regular counterpart's table. There is a 1 in 43.2 chance of rolling the unique drop table. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the standard rsrc550.  Upon release, greater abyssal demons were simply larger abyssal demons that had been recoloured blue. They received a graphical update with the 23 February 2017 update. Interestingly enough, greater abyssal demons are smaller than normal abyssal demons."

They are well known for their rsrc475 drop, as well as rsrc655. They can be rsrc17892 with rsrc78 or rsrc59 in the rsrc3909 as there are many pillars there. Another safe-spot is in rsrc5560 behind the burnt corpses (use second square south of the stalagmite and two squares away from the sitting burnt corpse). Finally, they can be safe-spotted by standing at the easternmost piece of land in their spawn area in the rsrc3524 or by using the mushrooms next to the stairs. The rsrc1323 has an easy safespot; stand under an arch which divides the area where the Greater Demons can be found. Another easy safespot in the Catacombs can be found in the extreme northeast corner of the dungeon, behind the rope to the surface. rsrc381, the rsrc17893 general in the rsrc467, his bodyguard rsrc6514, as well as rsrc716, the rsrc17777 in the rsrc1323, are considered greater demons for the purpose of a rsrc3482. The only place rsrc375 players can kill greater demons is in the rsrc1070. Since this is a rsrc1675 in high-level rsrc464, there is a high risk of getting killed by other players. Because of that, the best strategy to kill these is to bring as few items as possible. To do that, first train your rsrc81 level to 43 to use rsrc1264. Since the Ruins slowly restore your prayer, you can use this prayer permanently without draining your prayer points. Simply bring a weapon (for example rsrc2789) and an rsrc1080 or rsrc1002, and bring nothing else. That way, your damage per second is still maximised, but you don't risk losing your items. Alternatively, bring a rsrc16421 and rsrc7103, rsrc17894 and a rsrc1082, which allows you to use either rsrc10813 or rsrc10812 in combination with Protect from Melee without draining any prayer points, for a 10% rsrc64 or accuracy boost. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550. "

    "article-text": "Greater Nechryael are stronger variants of rsrc563 that require level 80 rsrc285 to kill. They are found exclusively within the rsrc1323. Like normal Nechryael, Greater Nechryael can summon up to two rsrc10792 when fighting a player. These Death spawn are the same as the ones summoned by normal nechryaels. Using rsrc1264 is recommended, as the greater Nechryael is more accurate and deals even more damage. rsrc1324 can be very effective against Nechryael, as these are considered to be rsrc1606. Unlike the rsrc636 who have a unique rsrc637 of their own, Greater Nechryael do not. They simply get the normal rsrc1330 instead. Much like rsrc685, Greater Nechryaels are popularly killed using rsrc10517 or rsrc2988, as you are able to clump them up into a pile and hit them all simultaneously. To do this, turn on rsrc1264, then attack the nechryaels with a fast ranged weapon (such as rsrc16474 or rsrc1695) or the special attack of the rsrc5354 to get them aggressive towards you. Run to a side of the room which has two corners adjacent to each other and run back and forth between the two corners so that the nechryaels pile on top of each other. Due to their very low rsrc59 defence, it's important to use equipment that maximises Magic damage instead of accuracy, such as a rsrc9556 or an rsrc57. Otherwise, wear items that give rsrc81 bonus to increase the usefulness of your rsrc1044. Bringing along rsrc17895 to cast rsrc3002 can also help extend your trips due to the fact that the summoned rsrc10792 can hit through your prayer. You can be healed up to full in as little as two casts if the nechrayaels are properly stacked, making it much more effective than bringing food. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550. "

They are found in various locations within the rsrc464 as well as in the rsrc3069. Green dragons are capable of breathing rsrc1395, which can hit up to 50 damage on players who are not wielding an rsrc1391 or rsrc1394. Using one of these shields will partially block the dragonfire, and using one of these shields with an rsrc1457 or rsrc5495 will block the dragonfire completely. Green dragons are assignable as a rsrc3482 by rsrc3738, rsrc6317 and rsrc7599. If players wish to avoid the rsrc17896 of the Wilderness when assigned green dragons as a Slayer task, either rsrc1940 within the rsrc3524 can be killed as an alternative or those in the rsrc3068 basement. If players want to challenge themselves, rsrc360 in the rsrc1289 can be killed instead. Warning: Green dragon hunters are frequently targeted by rsrc17897. If opting to kill green dragons in the Wilderness, an emergency rsrc16098, high healing rsrc184 and rsrc1044 are highly recommended in the event that you are attacked by another player.

    "article-text": "There are many guards in rsrc3096, usually in populated, major cities, such as rsrc437, rsrc378, rsrc23, and others. Guards also patrol the area just south of the rsrc9941 at rsrc259. Their rsrc173 ranges from 19-21, and they are quite weak. All guards are not rsrc10611 unless they are attacked first. In rsrc15991, there are unique level 1337 guards who are able to hit up to 30 with a very high accuracy (rsrc507 and rsrc2988). They are capable of rsrc5205 and negating rsrc81 completely. These guards will kill anyone who enters a safe zone with a rsrc265 instantly. The rsrc173 is a reference to leetspeak. Guards are also a popular rsrc403 drop monster due to their low level and ability to drop rsrc499. Completion of the rsrc6032 allows the player to have a 10% increased chance of receiving a clue scroll drop from guards in Falador.rsrc274 The guards in rsrc437 and rsrc259 wear an rsrc6226 and a rsrc3712 as rsrc4920. Their melee rsrc358 consists mostly of rsrc3622 and rsrc3610. Some guards wield rsrc972 and wear rsrc6907. The guards of rsrc23 wield a rsrc2783, rsrc2665, and a helmet that looks like a rsrc9540 without spikes. They also wear red trousers and blue shirts under their chainmail. Guards in rsrc378 wear unique armour and weapons that resemble that of a rsrc11304. Guards should not be confused with rsrc5684 in the rsrc1068, rsrc11306 and rsrc17900 in rsrc1632, rsrc11305 in rsrc1584, guards found at the entrance of the rsrc7127, or the aggressive rsrc11212 found in rsrc340. Guards can be pickpocketed at level 40 rsrc1870, giving 46.5 rsrc19. Guards are a decent alternative to rsrc1894, as they give 30 rsrc321 (rather than rsrc1024), and slightly more experience. A recommended way to efficiently thieve from Guards is to complete the rsrc128 rsrc132, setting your rsrc3840 to rsrc437, and pickpocket Falador guards until you die. Once you die, run straight up and pick up any coins that you died with. "

He uses rsrc507 equipment, which make him vulnerable to rsrc59 attacks. Guthan's set effect is Infestation, which gives him a 25% chance per rsrc813 to heal him for whatever damage is dealt for that hit. Guthan is often regarded as one of the easier brothers since he is inaccurate compared to most of the other brothers. He attacks using a warspear, so armour defensive against stab is advised. Despite his inaccuracy, he can still hit up to 24 so the use of rsrc1264 is advised for players with low rsrc30. Players who get hit often may also cause his set effect to activate more and thus he will heal more, making the fight longer. Using Protect from Melee also prevents his set effect from activating. Guthan is commonly defeated with the use of a rsrc1361/rsrc1354, rsrc848 or rsrc1366. Players can also use rsrc8121 or rsrc10497 on Guthan to attack him from a distance. "

    "article-text": "Harpie Bug Swarms are mid-level rsrc6905 that require a rsrc285 level of 33 to kill. A rsrc7579, which requires a rsrc317 level of 33 to light, is required to kill these rsrc16020 (an unlit lantern will not work). If you do not have 33 Firemaking, you cannot be assigned Harpie Bug Swarms as a rsrc16024.rsrc274 Harpie Bug Swarms should be an easy task for well-equipped mid-level players. Their abundance as well as the fact that they remain aggressive to players until level 93 combat makes this task very click-easy. However, Harpie Bug Swarms are very accurate, and will often hit for up to 6 rsrc65; thus, it is advisable to bring rsrc184 appropriate for the player's level. Many may find rsrc1929 suitable for the task. rsrc30 levels beginning roughly in the late 40s or early 50s or higher will prove helpful in defending against this enemy. It is recommended to bring rsrc2768 while slaying this monster since it has many drops that can be rsrc8 to free up rsrc424 spaces, and rsrc839 are frequently dropped from this monster. There is a rsrc16428 behind a bush in between two trees on the south side of the area. The closest rsrc16021 is dkp. Although you will need to run south and use the rsrc17346 to cross the river and then run north. Fairy ring ckr can also be used, though it's further to the south. Taking the former requires you to run past rsrc9350 and rsrc16139 rsrc534 before you can rsrc507 the swarms. You can also use the Ardougne cloak's teleport to the monastery, run north-east to captain Barnaby, take the boat to Brimhaven and run south and east to reach the swarms. You can also use a rsrc3845 and take the rsrc625 rsrc1101 to the crashed Karamja one which is slightly slower than the fairy rings. With 53 rsrc505, 21 rsrc64, 42 rsrc78, and any rsrc1687 and a rsrc16000, use the Karamja teleport option on a charged rsrc266, run southwest, and use the grapple agility shortcut. This is faster than any other travel method, but losing an inventory space for the crossbow if not ranging (or the grapple if ranging) may not be appealing to some players. Estimated drop rates are based off 1,000 kills.rsrc2761  "

The parts attack only with melee, so rsrc1264 is recommended. The head can only be defeated when the four level 99 tentacles are killed. The head can hit up to 20 hitpoints, and the tentacles can hit up to 12 hitpoints each. One strategy to kill this multi-part monster is to use rsrc1264 and kill the tentacle closest to the follower. When that is dead, the follower should be a little safer. Kill the other tentacles in order from the distance from the follower, closest to farthest. rsrc296 a tentacle works well as the poison damages all four tentacles as well as the head. If the head is near death and a tentacle is still alive, it will return to full health. When the tentacles are dead, the head should not be much of a problem. "

Hellhounds are an excellent source of rsrc655, as they drop them more frequently than other monsters. If players are on a Hellhound Task and they want to make some money off it, they could choose to kill rsrc1355 as his Hellhound spawns will count towards your task and you may also receive some generous drops from the boss. Killing rsrc2681 will also count towards your Hellhounds Task. As their rsrc173 suggests, hellhounds are not easy to defeat. It's worth noting, however, that their high combat level is mostly reflective of their accurate and powerful attacks; hellhounds have low defensive stats. Players with a low rsrc30 level should bring the best rsrc4920 that they can afford as well as high healing rsrc184. As they only attack with rsrc507, the rsrc1264 prayer can be used to nullify their attacks. The most effective yet afkable way to use this strategy is at the rsrc1323, as the area is a rsrc17906. Players who have completed at least easy tasks of the rsrc1624 can teleport to rsrc17907 to recharge rsrc16116, and teleport back via rsrc1376 Xeric's Heart option (requires full completion of rsrc10396) or the rsrc5540 spell (requires 69 rsrc59 and reading rsrc8229 to unlock the spell). Bring prayer-boosting armour such as the rsrc6983 for longer trips and some food just in case you run out of Prayer points and get hit by the hellhounds. Additionally, having a rsrc3277 in your inventory is beneficial as burying bones inside the Catacombs of Great Kourend also restores Prayer points. Prayer \"flicking\" can dramatically reduce the cost of fighting them; however, this requires close attention and probably some food to correct mistakes. Since they occupy a large space of 2-by-2 squares, hellhounds can easily be safe-spotted in rsrc2922 on rocks and columns, or in the rsrc10726. Players hunting hard clue scrolls can kill hellhounds located east of the rsrc10507 while wearing a rsrc4484. This doubles the drop rate of clue scrolls from hellhounds, from 1/64 to 1/32. Even though they're classed as demonic, the rsrc1324 does not work against them. If a rsrc1956 is checking your combat level, you are required to have at least level 75.  Although they are demons, Hellhounds drop bones instead of ashes like a regular demon would."

    "article-text": "A Hill Giant is a type of rsrc5464 found in several locations around rsrc15920, most highly concentrated in the far southern end of the rsrc3317. These dungeons may be accessed through the entrance located in the house north-east of rsrc594 and west of the rsrc1546 if the player has a rsrc3499. The Edgeville Dungeon area is usually very crowded in rsrc375 worlds, as players like to gather rsrc2475 to bury them for rsrc81 rsrc19. rsrc17 worlds usually are much less crowded due to the better rsrc4776 options for members. There are two Hill Giants present in level 17-18 rsrc464; however, very few people go there because of the dangerous rsrc518 in the area and its far distance from any bank. The closest bank for most Hill Giants in the Wilderness is in rsrc259. They are rsrc10611 to players below combat level 57. They have relatively low rsrc30 for their level, which makes them quite good for experience from level 30 to level 50. The Hill Giant is one of the creatures that could potentially drop a rsrc8157, making it a desirable monster both to train on for experience, due to its relatively high rsrc65 but low rsrc30, and for its respective scroll. Killing Hill Giants found within the rsrc1323 is one of the fastest ways to farm for rsrc1311 and rsrc4516 pieces because of their low rsrc65, allowing high level players to kill upwards of a couple hundred an hour. For low-levelled players, Hill Giants can be a great way to make money as they always drop rsrc2475, which are 295 coins each. The major and most noticeable drawback for free-to-play players is that the rsrc3317 is often crowded. For free-to-play players with a high Defence (~65+), a good way to save run energy while killing Hill Giants is to only equip rsrc3050. The relatively lower weight will allow you to run further without exhausting your energy, and your Defence will be high enough to negate a large amount of potential damage. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the rsrc16088.   They were once just called 'Giants', but this was later changed by rsrc2868 to avoid confusion between other rsrc5464. They are one of three kinds of giants available in free-to-play worlds, the other two being rsrc1322 and rsrc2489. Some Hill Giants appear to be wielding rsrc4464, weapons from the rsrc484 quest. Despite being called \"Hill Giants\", the majority of the giants are found in rsrc7584. The reason for the naming was revealed in a Postbag from the Hedge; they are called Hill Giants because the muscles on their arms resemble hills."

    "article-text": "Hopeless creatures are monsters encountered during rsrc1400, in the rsrc17910. A player must kill all 5 of the hopeless creatures in order for the rsrc15524 to appear. Each monster must be slain a total of 3 times before they will truly die. Each time a form is killed, they will retreat from the player and shrink in size. It should be noted that every time a player eats, 75% of the monster's current health is restored. These monsters can attack with ranged during the quest, but usually use melee to attack. When poisoned, hopeless creatures do NOT carry the rsrc296 on to their next forms. After the quest, hopeless creatures can be killed as a means to train combat. As the monsters have low rsrc30 and high health, it can prove to be a fruitful method of training. Additionally, the surrounding area is rarely occupied, meaning the spawns will have little competition. One downfall however, is that these monsters do not drop anything upon death. A rsrc1609 will be needed when entering the dungeon for the first time. "

    "article-text": "The Ice demon is one of the bosses encountered in the rsrc1178. The demon is initially frozen in place, blocking the way deeper into the chambers. In order to thaw it out, the braziers surrounding it must be lit, and rsrc7401 fuels them. There are plenty of trees outside the chamber it resides in to chop for tinder. Having a deposit chest built will greatly help for managing inventory space. There are four braziers surrounding the demon. An rsrc5637 occupies each brazier (one icefiend for each player in the team, capping at four icefiends). They do not move, but they will extinguish any lit fires near them. The more braziers lit, the faster the demon thaws. Once the ice demon is thawed, the icefiends will disappear and it will start attacking players. It has two attacks; a snow boulder and Ice Burst. The demon will take overhead prayers into account when fighting them; if the target is using rsrc3014, it will only use the snow boulder attack. If rsrc5495 is used instead, it will only use Ice Burst. Both attacks are AoE with a 3x3 radius, so one can avoid attacks completely by moving a few spaces away from their spot. The demon has low health compared to other monster puzzles, but compensates for this with very high Defence and a damage reduction effect. Though the demon has damage reduction effects for both range and melee attack styles, damage from fire spells and flames of zamorak are both Increased by a considerable amount, though inaccurate they may be. It is recommended to use Dragon Warhammer or Bandos Godsword special attacks to lower the Demon's defences.  In very large raids, teams would often quit if they encountered the Ice demon, as regardless of how much kindling was being put in the braziers, it would extinguish them at a very rapid rate in addition to the kindlings barely doing anything against the demon. This was later changed in a patch."

Climb up that one, and you will appear back on the surface. Then, take the eastern ladder. Follow the upcoming path (littered with rsrc2489 and rsrc8196) until you see another ladder.

    "article-text": "Ice troll females are most commonly found near the smaller rsrc398. They use powerful rsrc78 attacks that hit hard and fast. The damage dealt by these females can be reduced by equipping a rsrc17146 made during rsrc1613. However, the shield doesn't affect the accuracy of the attacks. Their accuracy seem to neglect all defence bonuses from stats and equipment; hence, they almost always are able to deal some damage. Despite possessing melee stats, ice troll females do not make use of it. Ice troll females are located in four places. They are firstly, in the rsrc4559 mines. Next, they are found amongst hordes of other trolls on the northern isle. They also found in the northern isle cave systems (the eastern cave before rsrc1613, and the western cave after). It should be emphasized that the ice trolls found on the northern isle (at the popular cannon slayer spot) do not drop any loot besides big bones. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550. "

    "article-text": "Normal Hard                                                 The Ice Troll King is the rsrc1708 monster for rsrc1613 rsrc15898, and is the leader of the rsrc564. He is located on the northern part of the isles in rsrc11904. He uses all three rsrc10737, which includes a rsrc507 attack, a rsrc59 attack that freezes players, and a rsrc78 in which he will throw rocks at players and a rsrc17911 move, which will send players flying across the battleground. He can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete. The main thing to be careful about is his rsrc15915 that knocks players backwards. Players should use the rsrc5495 or rsrc3014 rsrc81. rsrc1264 will result in the Troll King knocking the player into the cave wall for very high damage, which will repeat mutiple times, leaving them almost helpless; when players use either of the other prayers, it negates his attack, which knocks you back. Wear the rsrc10563 and rsrc17146 (created during the quest). This, combined with the rsrc5495 prayer, should keep damage taken to a minimum as the yak armour will greatly reduce his rsrc507 accuracy and the shield will lower his rsrc469. A one-handed rsrc5507 or better is advised to defeat the King as he has high defensive stats. One of the most widely-used ways to kill the King is to use the Protect from Magic prayer, along with the Fremennik round shield and the Yak-hide armour, because the prayer will protect you from the troll's rsrc59 attack, and your Fremennik shield and yak-hide armour will greatly reduce the damage (and not just the accuracy) of the troll's Melee and rsrc78 attacks, and he will not hit you for more than 1 or 2 rsrc65 with each hit. Another way of defeating him is to simply use a rsrc1129 and to stand well away from him. This will cause him to use Ranged attacks dealing small amounts of damage to you and him. This method uses a lot of food and may still result in death if you are unlucky. Another strategy is to use the Protect from Missiles prayer. If this prayer is used, the Troll King can only use magical and close-range (melee) attacks, and players can negate his attack, which knocks them backwards. However, he can still freeze players with his magical attack, which can be highly annoying and a waste of Prayer, and Protect from Missiles has a higher Prayer requirement. Bear in mind also that the damage taken from the Magic attack is not reduced nearly as much by equipment, if at all. For these reasons, Protect from Magic is generally recommended. After the Ice Troll King is dead, decapitate him and take the rsrc5212 to the rsrc4590 to show you have defeated him. For further detail on this and other parts of the quest, see rsrc1613 quest guide. "

    "article-text": "Ice troll runts are the lowest levels of rsrc10410 found on rsrc4559 and rsrc1611. They hit harder than their combat level suggests and also have the ability to hit through armour, similar to rsrc13433. rsrc10563 reduces the troll's maximum hit and thus is recommended over armour with higher defensive bonuses. It is advised to use the rsrc1264 prayer whenever engaging more than one at a time. Ice troll runts are often found near rsrc394; when they're not, they will be spread farther out. Ice troll runts are not found on the northern isle with the rest of the ice trolls, but they are found in the cave systems (the eastern cave before completion of rsrc1613, and the western cave after). They're also found south of the bridge to the troll isle just north-west of rsrc1611. In this location, they tend to engage in combat with the rsrc11912 just east of the bridge. While they prefer to attack the guards, they will attack a player if the player is their first target, until they grow tolerant of the player. Players can get a drop with at least one rsrc813, letting the guards do the rest of the work. This tactic can be used effectively with rsrc78 and rsrc59, to stay out of the way of hits. This is an excellent choice for training rsrc285 if a player has received a troll task, as they have better drops than their rsrc593 counterparts and the player can complete the task more quickly and safely since they are constantly fighting with the guards. However, if a guard deals the finishing blow or attacks a runt as it dies in the same rsrc17912 as the player, the Slayer experience gained will be halved.   Players who have done the rsrc9148 quest can make their own rsrc10563 using items easily obtained on rsrc1611. It thus is very inexpensive and has good damage-stopping properties against trolls."

Ice warriors have good accuracy and can cut through rsrc78 and rsrc59 armour with ease. Food such as rsrc1204 or better is advised. Wearing rsrc17700 or rsrc16144 will be a good option, as the warrior's melee attacks will be less effective. Ice warriors are weak against fire spells and crush weapons. In the Asgarnian Ice Dungeon, they can be rsrc16428 by trapping an ice warrior on one side of a plus shaped formation of rocks near the entrance into the next part of the dungeon. At the rsrc5639 they can be safespotted directly south of the dungeon marker, or in the ladder area (1 step west of middle ladder or east of tree.

    "article-text": "The Icelords are icy beings that live inside the rsrc7378, and were found when rsrc10694 moved much of the rsrc9570 population to the Iceberg to prepare for the invasion of rsrc3096. They have four arms, and are quite adept in using these to pummel their enemies into submission, while some prefer to hurl large icicles at adventurers. Pescaling Pax intends to use these as a strike force when they do invade the mainland. Icelords are encountered during the rsrc4476 quest. They are in a cage on the Penguin's Iceberg that is explored during the quest. After the quest is finished, they can be accessed by entering \"A Crack\" again, and re-entering the cage. Inside the Cage, there are three Icelords that use rsrc507, and one wielding icicles that uses rsrc78. They are weak to rsrc10525 and rsrc15936 attacks, so it is recommended to use rsrc828 or better, or a longsword or scimitar, preferably of rsrc16533. The main reason for making the trip back to fight them is because they can be used as a replacement for rsrc379 during a rsrc16024. They provide one more experience compared to Ice warriors. They also have an \"advantage\" of most of the time having only one drop, rsrc2475 (they also drop rsrc3286 rarely), negating the need for rsrc1074, therefore allowing them to be killed en masse. It is recommended that lower-levelled players (and most other players) bring a half-inventory of rsrc2835, as these creatures do not hit hard or frequently, but it will add up as time goes on. This allows for greater numbers to be killed."

When assigned as rsrc16020 for a rsrc3482, beware of their accurate magic attack. Infernal Mages use a weaker version of the spell rsrc867 to attack the player, so it is recommended to wear rsrc10580 or rsrc10471, which will reduce their chance to hit. Wearing rsrc5471 is a good option because of its high magic defence. The rsrc5495 prayer is recommended for lower levels, as these mages hit extremely often. rsrc15439 is an effective strategy to minimise their damage output. They are weak to ranged, so it is advisable to bring the best rsrc972, rsrc1884 or rsrc1687 available. (Be aware though that if you kill an Infernal Mage right before its spell animation has started it will still cast that spell even during its death animation)  Infernal Mages appear to be wielding a green version of the rsrc1350, along with a set of green, decaying rsrc4666. They appear to be casting rsrc867, however their max hit suggests they are actually casting rsrc881. Due to their high accuracy, damaging magic attacks, and lack of consistent valuable rsrc273, players often skip Infernal Mage rsrc3482."

His apprentice downstairs from him remarks that because he is a necromancer adventurers constantly attack him and leave his house a mess, which leaves him to keep it clean until Invrigar returns from his respawn point.

Although they are the second weakest of the six, it is especially dangerous to kill them as with all metal dragons, due to their ability to shoot long-range rsrc1395. A rsrc1394, or an rsrc1391, coupled with an rsrc1457 is necessary for full dragonfire protection. Having only one form of protection will result in some dragonfire damage being inflicted onto the player. rsrc59/rsrc78 is a common method of killing these creatures since they will not attempt to close in the distance to rsrc507, thus rendering the character invulnerable as long as they keep their dragonfire protection (with both an antifire potion AND an anti-dragon shield). Melee users are recommended to use the rsrc1264 prayer, as they can hit very hard. Their defence is also high, so ranged (with range boosting prayers/potions), magic, or a stabbing weapon like the rsrc275 are effective in taking them out. With the completion of the rsrc17199, Iron dragons killed in rsrc3524 will have their rsrc2193 noted. If they are fought without complete dragonfire protection, it is recommended to stay in melee range and use rsrc1264, to reduce the amount of dragonfire damage taken. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550. "

During rsrc8375, the player uncovers that the curse that has befallen the crew was actually Ithoi poisoning the crew's dinner, due to Captain Tock's consideration of firing him and replacing his position as second-in-command with rsrc11099, rsrc17167's brother, as they no longer need a navigator now that they have settled in the Corsair Cove. By \"cursing\" the crew with poisoned food, Ithoi hoped that he would be able to stay with the crew due to his knowledge of curses. He too pretended to fall under the \"curse\". The player eventually proves that Ithoi was responsible for poisoning the crew and faking the \"curse\", so Captain Tock has the player kill him for his treachery. He is a capable mage, being able to use elemental bolt spells as well as the rsrc3184 spell. He can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete.

    "article-text": "Jal-Ak is a monster fought in the rsrc6113. Jal-Ak is similar to the rsrc13242 fought in the rsrc4994. Jal-Ak, however, is much more powerful. Its magic and ranged attacks can each hit in the high 20s. Jal-Ak attacks every 6 rsrc1473, and 3 ticks before each attack Jal-Ak will detect what rsrc7104 the player is using and will change its rsrc10566 depending on whether the player is using rsrc5495 or rsrc3014. If the player is not using any protection prayer, Jal-Ak's attack will be of a random style. However, there is a delay in the attack animation, so switching to other protection prayer before the projectile is launched will block the damage. This delay is particularly useful when the player must leave a rsrc8361, leaving the player vulnerable to attack from both Jal-Ak and another monster; Jal-Ak will be off-tick from the other monster, such that the two monsters will not launch their attacks on the same tick. When Jal-Ak dies, it splits into 3 smaller versions of itself, each using a different style of the combat triangle: rsrc13243 (Ranged), rsrc13237 (Mage), and rsrc13244 (Melee). Translations of some words and phrases in the TzHaar language were revealed in rsrc16012 via the rsrc17918 book. According to this text, Jal means foreign, or not TzHaar, and Ak means forked or twin."

Even so, it's usually better to kill the lower-levelled monsters first, as they can still hit hard and have much lower Defence and hitpoints than Jal-Zek. The revived monsters respawn near the center of the arena, which is often a more favourable position. Jal-Zek will only use its respawn mechanic while in combat. Jal-Zek will not attack at the same time that it is reviving another monster, and the monsters that are revived will have a slight delay before attacking the player. Prior to an update, Jal-Zek's attacks and movements would be less predictable after revival. Jal-Zek's examine is a reference to the song Great Balls of Fire by Jerry Lee Lewis."

They can also be hunted as part of the rsrc14769 activity; each jubbly killed will count as one chompy in the player's kill count. Jubblies are not particularly hard to hunt. They do not actually attack you and only run a few squares away when they get too close to you. A good spot to hunt them is just to the east of the rsrc1101, south east of the rsrc430 arena, in the Feldip hills. Once they are killed, they must be plucked to receive the drops. The feathers go into your inventory automatically, while the other drops appear on the ground."

A jubster is created by a player using a rsrc3436 and a rsrc3969 on the jubster Altar of Life in the dungeon and then activating the altar found in the east part of the dungeon. The rsrc10689 in the dungeon then creates the monster, which appears near the altar and will attack the player. If players wish to obtain raw jubbly, it is advised to kill these if they have a high combat. The jubster will always drop raw jubbly in small amounts. It is much easier than baiting and waiting for a jubbly to arrive. "

    "article-text": "Normal Hard                                                 The Jungle demon is a quest monster fought during the rsrc47 quest. It is among the strongest rsrc1606 in the game. It uses extremely strong rsrc59 attacks and, when in range, a rsrc498-like rsrc507 attack. It is possible to let the rsrc172 around it take it to about 10 hitpoints, while you are hiding across the bridge at the edge of rsrc12447. Afterwards, you can run out to quickly finish it off. However, if the gnomes \"kill\" the demon, it will restore 20% of its hitpoints, so you cannot fully rely on the rsrc11675 to kill it. Like all demons, it is susceptible to the effects of the rsrc2789, rsrc1321 and rsrc1324. It can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete. The Jungle Demon alternates between all four rsrc4293 for its magic attacks, and its melee attack is like a halberd (which means that it can hit two tiles away). Both types of attacks can hit up to 32 damage. The recommended equipment to bring when fighting the Jungle Demon would probably be 2-3 four dose rsrc1044 depending on your rsrc81 level (37 for rsrc5495 makes the fight considerably easier). Without Protect from Magic, a high magic defence and lots of food may be required. The rest of your inventory should have rsrc3982 or better, as well as magic or ranging equipment, depending on your method of attack. The easiest way to kill the Jungle Demon is to hide at the edge of the arena, waiting until the gnomes get him down to about 10 hitpoints. Afterwards, you can run out and finish it quickly. The Jungle Demon will regenerate to 20% of its full health if you do not deal the final blow. For those without 37 Prayer, the above method is highly recommended. Be sure to equip high magic defence gear and farcast it using rsrc78 or Magic spells. Alternatively, a rsrc278 rsrc15915 can be used four times in a row, which is very likely to knock it out as well. Those with 37 Prayer can simply attack the Jungle Demon from a distance by either using Ranged or Magic spells while using the Protect from Magic prayer. Using a rsrc984, fewer than twenty (20) rsrc17929 may be used, making the cannon the most effective way to kill the demon. Although most demons are very weak to Magic, the Jungle Demon is very resistant even against higher level rsrc4293, so it is not recommended. Due to the demon attacking with both Magic and melee at close range, it is not recommended to use melee. Doing so would prohibit you from praying against all damage. If melee is however your only option, be sure to use a rsrc10665 or rsrc16410, as the Jungle Demon has high rsrc15936 defence.  If you kill the demon as it kills you (or if you kill it using rsrc10560), the kill will count and you will still be able to finish the quest. The demon is currently the only one of its kind; however, its examine text implies that there may be more of its kind, including lesser jungle demons."

Jungle horrors have a fairly low number of Hitpoints for their combat level and appear to be weak to rsrc78 and Stab attacks. Players with medium level rsrc30 are advised to bring food (rsrc1929 or better) and armour to negate the jungle horror's relatively accurate melee attacks. Alternatively, players with a high Defence level can sustain themselves by cutting jungle horrors' commonly dropped rsrc941. Simply bring a rsrc556 to cut it into rsrc8565.

    "article-text": "K'ril Tsutsaroth (pronounced \"KRILL TUTT-zuh-roth\") is the boss of the rsrc17934 in the rsrc467. To gain access to his chamber, players must kill 40 Zamorakians. He uses rsrc507 and rsrc59 attacks. He is typically killed on a slayer task. K'ril Tsutsaroth is classified as a rsrc619; thus, killing him counts towards any greater demon rsrc16024 and also allows a player to take advantage of the abilities of a rsrc1710 or Slayer helmet, if they have a greater demon Slayer task. As a demon, he is also susceptible to rsrc1324's passive effect. K'ril is the least popular of all of the rsrc1224 bosses, as his unique drops do not have as much value compared to the other generals. A trip is also more tedious; his prayer smashes can quickly drain a tanking player's supplies and players cannot use rsrc1431 tabs to extend their trip as he and his bodyguards all drop ashes. Like other God Wars Dungeon bosses, K'ril roams around a rectangular room with his bodyguards until a player enters, attacking them on sight. He attacks primarily with Melee and Magic, and his bodyguards use a different combat style each. He may also use a Magic based attack that drains the player's Prayer points as well as dealing high damage. If all players leave, his health and stats will be reset.  K'ril was classified as a rsrc1325 during development. He was reclassified as a rsrc619 when the rsrc467 was released on 17 October 2013. At Old School RuneScape's first rsrc124, players could speak to K'ril Tsutsaroth, resulting in the following dialogue: K'ril: Human, I disconnected and lost my plastic plate of whatever food you call this. I want my items returned, now! Player: Woah hold on big fella' I can't do that. K'ril: Well then, I'll just unsubscribe from the dungeon and stop playing all together. Hrmph.... Player: Oh please, you were never really a popular boss anyway. You had to be given extra drops just to incentivise people to find you. Even then, I doubt anyone would notice if you disappeared. K'ril: *growls* Enjoy the party... mortal. K'ril: Human, I disconnected and lost my plastic plate of whatever food you call this. I want my items returned, now!

An alternative route upon completion of rsrc3232, lies south of rsrc1271, beyond the rsrc9636. They can also be found in the rsrc5288; a rsrc3482 is required to kill them there. Players will need a rsrc1609 in order to access the Kalphite Lair. It is necessary to bring some form of rsrc1037 if using rsrc507 to kill these. There are rsrc78 rsrc16428 at the entrance to the caves due to the size of the creature. Kalphite Guardians will inflict rsrc296 very frequently (even if you have the rsrc1264 prayer on) which starts at 6 damage. They can hit for up to 16 melee damage and are quite accurate. They can be safely ranged from a couple locations. rsrc246 are most vulnerable to rsrc5634 style attacks; however, most players still prefer to use rsrc252 or rsrc639 in favour of better attack speed. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the standard rsrc550. "

The Kalphite Queen, along with rsrc685 and rsrc818, is notable for dropping the rsrc5435 armour. The Kalphite Queen is one of the toughest monsters in RuneScape. She can inflict large amounts of damage with her rsrc78 and rsrc59 attacks as they always result in a rsrc813.rsrc274 It is recommended for players to bring an emergency teleport such as an rsrc5708 or rsrc17940, or only bring items into the rsrc5287 they are willing to lose. The Kalphite Queen resides in her rsrc5287 southwest of the Shantay Pass. If you are lucky and fast, you can run from the Shantay Pass to the Kalphite Lair fast enough so that the rsrc2708 does not affect you. Alternatively, the rsrc17605 BIQ can take you to right outside the Lair entrance. You will require a rsrc1609 to enter the dungeon, which will be used in the process. A second rope is required to reach the lower level where Kalphite Queen resides. Completion of the Elite rsrc5281 removes the need to bring ropes each time. In addition, those with access to rsrc1271 can find a tunnel in the Dorgesh-Kaan South Dungeon that leads through to the Kalphite Lair, emerging near the rsrc592. The Kalphite Queen has a rsrc173 of 333. Each form has 255 rsrc65, and her rsrc78 and rsrc59 attacks have 100% accuracy. She may also use a decently accurate melee attack. The Queen has two forms: in the first, she is an immense scarab beetle, and in her second, a giant wasp. She switches forms only after the first has been fully defeated. As a beetle, she is extremely resistant to Magic and Ranged attacks, as indicated by her overhead rsrc17941. As a wasp, she is resistant to Melee attacks. Therefore, players should be prepared to use both Melee and Ranged or Magic. Each of her attacks have a max hit of 31. Her rsrc78 attacks consists of her shooting barbed spines from her abdomen. If there are players close to the person being targeted with this attack they will also be hit, to avoid this players can stand on opposite sides of the Kalphite Queen. Her rsrc59 attack bounces from player to player. Her rsrc507 attack can also hit high, but is much less accurate than the Magic and Ranged attacks. There is a 1 in 16 chance of rolling the herb table.rsrc2761  The Kalphite Queen was previously the only known entity able to use simultaneous overhead rsrc7104. rsrc17942 The Kalphite Queen's original drops were much worse, similar to the rsrc616's before their drop tables were updated due to player feedback. Prior to a poll, only the second form counted towards the damage needed to obtain drops after her death. This upset players as crashers would come when a player was on the second form, taking the drop from them with minimal effort. This has since been changed, and now players who did the most damage to both forms will obtain the drop. If the second form stays alive for a long period of time, it will revert back to the first form and retain the second form's remaining rsrc65. When the first form is killed again, a second form with full health will emerge, akin to rsrc1355. If stat-draining rsrc1267 are used on her first form, the stat reductions will carry over to the second form.rsrc5332"

They guard the entrance to the lair of the rsrc2464. These are highly dangerous because of their ability to rsrc296 without dealing melee damage, often dealing 4 damage per round, and they inhabit a rsrc17944. A player can choose to hunt these for rsrc285 when given the task to kill rsrc246. When given this task, a player can choose to kill any of the Kalphite family (rsrc4893, Soldiers, rsrc634 or the rsrc2464). Killing Kalphite Soldiers will grant 90 Slayer XP per kill. Using a rsrc984 in their chamber yields one of the best rsrc17945 rates next to rsrc2216 rsrc1319, and therefore many players use cannons to train here. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the rsrc16088. "

When players kill her, during or after the quest, a message appears saying \"Kalrag slumps to the floor...\" and the rsrc10722 in the room will become rsrc16139 and attack with rsrc507. The blessed spiders nearby will attack you with melee after you kill Kalrag. It is recommended for the player to wear full rune or above so that the blessed spiders deal very little damage. It is possible to safe-spot Kalrag as she uses melee, so you could equip the bow and arrows you brought to pass the bridge in order to attack from a distance.

He uses rsrc10497 that will freeze the player. He resides in a freezing environment which will constantly lower the player's stats, providing an additional threat when fighting him. Kamil makes a reappearance in the rsrc484 final battle as rsrc4380. He can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete. Kamil is reached east of the rsrc5992, north of rsrc946. First go north-west of Trollheim (the easiest way to get there is by rsrc7485, which requires 61 rsrc59 and completion of rsrc940) and walk to the Ice Gate. Squeeze between the gate, kill five rsrc564 to get the cave to open. Enter the cave and head up the Ice Path, past the rsrc10358 and there will be a clearing. Kamil will soon appear when the player walks a few steps past a boulder. Since Kamil hits higher with rsrc507, it is advised to use rsrc1264 and wear armour that defends well against rsrc59. Note that Kamil's Magic attack is very accurate and the icy environment will constantly lower the player's stats which also means their Magic resistance is lowered each time, so it may be a good idea to assume most of Kamil's Magic attacks will be a rsrc813 and the player maximises their offensive bonuses. Kamil is immune to spells other than rsrc10525; this immunity includes rsrc848, rsrc1354/rsrc1361 and rsrc837. rsrc1053 or rsrc1044 and rsrc1034 are advised to counter the freezing environment and in order to restore rsrc81. If using Magic, rsrc792, rsrc7402, rsrc16070, or rsrc17947 are a good choice. Players should not use a Fire spell if their Magic level is around the level to cast it, as they will constantly need to drink restore potions; instead they should pick a lower-level Fire spell, an effective countermeasure to the freezing environment which constantly lowers stats. Players who have completed rsrc9 may wish to take advantage of the rsrc4289 which will raise the max hit of rsrc828 to 15. Kamil is also considered an rsrc379 in regards to rsrc3482, so if the player has ice warriors as their current task a rsrc2785 or equivalent would provide a damage bonus against him.  Kamil (\u0643\u0627\u0645\u0644) is an Arabic word and name that means \"complete\"."

She is the female counterpart of rsrc7047 (from rsrc1336) and is very similar to the original. As soon as the battle begins, run up to her and use a crush weapon or fire spells. Remember to use one that's far below your magic level because her spells can lower rsrc15940, as well as reducing a player's rsrc15915 bar to 0, so rsrc16014 are highly recommended. While fighting, she will freeze the player and rsrc5544 away from the player, so patience (as well as a one click teleport) is advised. She can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete. However, her Nightmare Zone version is currently bugged and will freeze players rapidly and repeatedly, reducing their stats to 1.If you fight her in rsrc238, turn on protect from magic and leave it on. Karamel will teleport next to you and start using melee until protect from magic is turned off. If you are a low level player, DO NOT underestimate her magic attacks, as they can hit rapid 7s. The best way to avoid damage is to run up in front of her, so she can use her very inaccurate melee attack as well. Note: the player cannot use rsrc81 in this boss fight or any other rsrc484 boss fight."

He uses rsrc78 equipment, which make him vulnerable to rsrc507 attacks. Also unlike a player using rsrc1126, he is also fairly weak to rsrc59 attacks. Karil's set effect is Tainted Shot, which gives him a 25% chance per rsrc813 to lower the player's rsrc505 by 20%. His set effect does not pose a threat in combat however his attacks are very accurate even on players with high defensive bonuses, so players may find it difficult navigating to the chest later with a lower Agility level (and as a result, less rsrc1874). As such, it is strongly recommended to activate rsrc17868 - note that this does not prevent his set effect from activating. The use of a rsrc1053 potion may be worth using after the fight if the player's Agility stat has been drained significantly. Karil's weakness is melee (in particular stab and slash) so the use of an rsrc252, rsrc1709 or rsrc275 is advised. He does have a moderate amount of melee defence, so players may prefer to use Magic instead - rsrc1361/rsrc1354, rsrc848 or rsrc1366 are common. Karil's unconventional weakness to rsrc59 is because he has a low Magic level. He has the same Magic defence bonus as his armour when worn by players (+106), but since rsrc597 Magic resistance is determined by Magic level, as well as magic defence bonus, it results in him being fairly weak to Magic overall."

An orange Ket-Zek is fought on wave 62, the only wave in which the player encounters two of them at once. The orange Ket-Zek's spawn location marks the spot where rsrc3483 will spawn on the next, final wave. It uses powerful melee and magic attacks, both capable of hitting in the high 40s. For this reason, the prayer rsrc5495 is necessary. Its magic attack is depicted as a fire ball flung from the tail. It will lunge at players who get too close to it. It is best to dispatch a Ket-Zek with ranged, as while it is just as weak against melee attacks, staying in the Ket-Zek's melee distance results in unnecessary damage. The rsrc1671 can easily kill a Ket-Zek due to its high Magic level. Killing one of these is a required task in the hard rsrc332 for rsrc1066. Ket-Zek are colloquially referred to as \"the 360s\" by players in reference to their combat level. The Ket-Zek has a \"defend\" animation which is rarely seen due to its rapid attack speed."

He drops two of the rsrc6488 needed for the rsrc1091. He is a very dangerous foe armed with a Khazard rsrc671, and can hit very accurately up to 9 damage. He is also wearing a rsrc17948 and a dark coloured rsrc9540 without the spikes. Even though he attacks with a warhammer, he has the attacking speed of a scimitar. During Tree Gnome Village, the player confronts the warlord, and demands the orbs from him. The Warlord refuses and then attacks the player. When the player has killed the warlord, he or she should search the warlord's satchel and find the two remaining orbs. The player then needs to bring these back to rsrc6487 in order to complete the quest. It is advised to have rsrc17700 or better when fighting him. Low level players should strongly consider bringing food and prayer potions if they plan to use melee, and even then may not be able to kill him. He may be safe-spotted with ranging or magic by stepping out of his area boundary, forcing him to flee from the player. If he is trapped along the northwestern side of the large mound, he can be safespotted from the southeastern side of the mound without him moving. He can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete. The Khazard Warlord led the charge when rsrc9340 ordered his men to invade the Tree Gnome Village. When the player stole the first orb, and returned it to King Bolren, Bolren informs the player that the Warlord and his troops came in and killed gnome women (among them his wife) and some gnome children, and took the other two orbs. The player then is told to kill him. "

    "article-text": "Ranged: 13+ Killerwatts are rsrc285 monsters located in the rsrc10720, accessed through a portal on the top floor of rsrc1155. Level 37 Slayer and completion of rsrc6133 are required to kill them. Players are suggested to wear rsrc7115 when fighting killerwatts - not wearing them will result in taking increased damage from the killerwatt's rsrc78 attacks due to lightning strikes; however, this damage can still be negated with rsrc3014. A rsrc984 cannot be set up in the killerwatt plane. Killerwatts are much more dangerous than what their rsrc173 may suggest; both their rsrc78 and rsrc507 attacks will hit players every 1.2 seconds, much faster than the speed of an rsrc252 or rsrc633, and their melee attacks are exceptionally accurate, although rsrc17950 is still possible despite their attack speed. Using Ranged or rsrc59 from across clouds will limit them to their Ranged attack, allowing players with rsrc7104 to safely complete this rsrc16024. Their Ranged attack is Magic-based, and thus equipment with high Magic Defence such as rsrc3050 will provide the best protection against the Ranged attack. Contrary to popular belief, their melee attack is NOT magic based, and as such your best melee armor is most effective when using the 'baiting' method (where the player selects to attack the enemy but clicks away before landing their first attack, leading to the killerwatt only using melee attacks). Killerwatts initially appear as floating balls of electricity, but will grow limbs if attacked. Though they aren't aggressive, they will immediately retaliate after being clicked on, and will try to get within melee range of the player before attacking. Because of this, it is possible to stop a killerwatt from using Ranged attacks entirely by clicking on it with a Melee weapon equipped and then waiting for it to attack first. A killerwatt that has targeted a player will not stop following them until they log out or leave the killerwatt plane. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the rsrc16088.   *The name is a play on \"rsrc17951\", a unit of power, with the word \"killer\" included to imply their hostility, or that they may give a deadly amount of watts. During rsrc1866, and while unlocking routes for the rsrc1867, some killerwatts can be seen standing on top of clouds, trees, rocks and buildings. Despite this, they cannot be fought anywhere outside of the killerwatt plane."

    "article-text": "The King Black Dragon, commonly referred to as KBD, is a three-headed dragon located in rsrc8360 deep in the rsrc464. The King Black Dragon has a rsrc173 of 276, which makes him one of the strongest rsrc1694 in rsrc1469. Players should not take this foe lightly, and they should always take an rsrc1391 as his rsrc1395 breath is very deadly without protection. The King Black Dragon can also be killed as an alternative for a rsrc553 rsrc3482. Although he will always fight back when attacked, he has gotten bored over the centuries from adventurers attacking him as he revealed to his good friend, rsrc16013. While the King Black Dragon's lair is entered from within the Wilderness, his lair itself is not part of the Wilderness, so players cannot attack each other in his lair. Completion of the rsrc5711 also does not note his bone drops, and the KBD does not count towards a black dragon slayer assignment given by rsrc7599. Players can pay 50,000 coins from their inventory to open an instanced version of the KBD lair (right-click Private option on lever), where it will be inaccessible by other players. However, once players leave, the rsrc11750 will expire and they will have to pay 50,000 coins to open another instance. If players leave any items in the instance, they will disappear. This means that if a player dies or disconnects while inside a KBD instance, their items will not be retrievable. King Black Dragon rsrc17235 time is 9 seconds. The King Black Dragon can also rsrc296 and reduce the player's rsrc7862 as well as inflict damage, so rsrc1037 (rsrc17880 is preferred) and stat-restoring potions, such as rsrc1053, are highly recommended. He has three unblockable breath attacks: Poison, Shock, and Freeze. His normal rsrc1395 has a max hit of 65 with no protection, 15 with the rsrc1391 or rsrc1394, and completely blocked with both the shield and rsrc1457. Again, his dragonfire is significantly stronger than normal dragonfire, which has a max hit of 65 if unprotected, so players need to be sure they have one of the aforementioned shields equipped at all times. His poison, shock, and freeze breaths can be reduced to 10 damage using either of the said shields. Although an antifire potion reduces 75% of all damage against these three unique attacks, it will only nullify all damage from the normal dragonfire. Thus, the player will be fully protected from the KBD's regular dragonfire with the proper shielding and an antifire, but his special breaths can still deal up to 10 damage. rsrc5495 doesn't protect against or reduce damage of dragonfire when an anti-dragon shield or equivalent is equipped.  In addition to the drops above, this monster  has a 1/16 chance to access the standard rsrc550. The King Black Dragon can talk, as seen in rsrc1498. During the final cutscene, he is visited by rsrc16280. During the chat between the King and Bob, rsrc15543 attempts to solo the King, is unable to damage him, and is killed in one hit as he had no rsrc1395 protection at all. As of an rsrc17952 on 18 February 2016, players can open instances for fighting the King Black Dragon. As of 13 March rsrc75, the King Black Dragon has a chance of dropping the rsrc96. Prior to the release of rsrc230, the examine text of the King Black Dragon was The biggest, meanest dragon around."

King Roald is the son of King rsrc17227, a monarch most famous for his efforts to reclaim the Shield of rsrc2167 from the rsrc3594 and rsrc2731. Although little is currently known of King Roald's early history, he is known to have had a pampered upbringing, learning to read from the Palace's librarian, rsrc3333. Since his rise to the position of king, Roald III has been accepted by most as a generally good ruler. Under his rule, the city of rsrc378 has prospered greatly, and has seen the renovation of the rsrc1217. Yet, despite this, there are certain groups that feel Roald is weak in the face of the Church of rsrc1222, and others that would go so far as to see him assassinated. His hesitance in matters such as the recent conflicts with rsrc2264 have earned him many enemies. During the rsrc519 quest, players must visit King Roald to collect a reward for returning the Shield of Arrav to the rsrc1217. Originally, King Roald had no role in the quest, but an update gave him a small part in the quest's ending. You can start the rsrc2265 quest by speaking to King Roald. During the rsrc1163 rsrc15898, he falls under a mind control spell cast by rsrc7098 and is forced to fight against the player. He is level 47 and can only be defeated if the player summons rsrc2342 when he is at zero rsrc65. He is immune to damage from the rsrc1128 spell, rsrc17228 and rsrc296. The same day the quest was released, King Roald's graphics were revamped. If you have completed the rsrc16689 quest, while fighting King Roald, he will shout phrases like \"I'm allergic to roses!\" and \"That garden was awful!\", which is a reference to the quest. If rsrc519 is completed, he will also say, \"A member of the Phoenix Gang?\" In the culmination of rsrc230, players seek his aid at the behest of rsrc13971 and rsrc12821.  Roald is suggested to be greedy - as seen in Shield of Arrav when he pays the player only half of the bounty his grandfather put out to recover the shield, and again in Priest in Peril when he mentions he would have sent a squire to check in on rsrc2262, but all the squires wanted payment for the task."

Knights of Ardougne can be pickpocketed at level 55 rsrc1870, giving the rsrc16059 a rsrc4765 worth 50 coins and 84.3 Thieving rsrc19. The rsrc5149 increase your success rate. Failing to pickpocket will result in being hit for 3 points of damage. They are a good source of rsrc1870 experience, with ~3,000 pickpockets possible in an hour. Players will stop failing to pickpocket at level 95 Thieving with the Medium rsrc1624 completed. It is also good to note that at around level 90 rsrc1870, it is possible to regenerate health faster than the Knight can deal damage whilst pickpocketing them if a rsrc2440 is worn either in conjunction with a rsrc6964 or the rsrc233 prayer, providing the maximum health regeneration; however the effects of the hitpoints cape and Rapid Heal prayer do not stack. A common training method is to lure a knight to the north-east house in ardougne market (east of the Silk Stall) and repeatedly pickpocket the knight. This method only works by luring the south-east most knight in the market to the north-east house, then shutting the door. The knight will only move between the 2 southernmost tiles in the house. The player can then set NPC attack options to \"Hidden\" (under the \"Controls\" panel in the \"Settings\" tab) and repeatedly left-click on the knight. By positioning the camera correctly, it is possible to repeatedly click the exact same spot without moving the mouse before opening the rsrc4765. The knight must be able to move freely between the southern two tiles, or he will despawn. If pickpocketing the knight with the full rogue's set from 55 thieving to 99 thieving, one can expect to gain about 15.5m. A known bug with a Knight of Ardougne occurs when two people fail to pickpocket at the same time. Doing so will result in the knight temporarily disappearing, or \"flickering\", for 1-2 seconds. Some players incorrectly believe that \"flickering\" is caused by players wielding weapons while pick-pocketing, this however is a myth. "

He is fought to gain entrance to the Mage Arena, where players fight for their god of choice. When a player fights him, during the Mage Arena miniquest, he first starts out as a rsrc4298, then a rsrc534, a rsrc7412, a rsrc1313, and finally rsrc843, (which is the only form to have a combat level) at level 112. To prevent large hits, it is recommended that players achieve level 37 rsrc81 to use rsrc5495. Also, they should bring the required runes for their highest-level and most powerful spell since you can not use melee or ranged to fight him, and either at least 20 or 25 cooked sharks (to keep up life points during the battle), or a few rsrc1044 (when using prayer). He attacks players with the three rsrc1358, which all have a maximum hit of 20, regardless of the form he is in. After Kolodion is defeated, players may enter the sparkling pool, where players can then worship one of the three god statues, dedicated to rsrc2168, rsrc1222 and rsrc1220. They will then receive a rsrc16867, based on their choice. They can then claim that rsrc16573 by speaking to the rsrc9240 for free, and additional staves (of any god) for 80,000 coins each. Kolodion's final form is considered a rsrc843 towards a rsrc3482. "

    "article-text": "Koschei the deathless is a rsrc3936 warrior that players must fight in order to complete  rsrc34 quest. The player must defeat him three times without dying; although they are told they must defeat him to win, the act of dying to him having defeated him three times is considered enough to win you the vote. This is because the test is one of bravery, not strength. Koschei's level is not shown; however, he will get progressively stronger and his attacks faster each time he is defeated. His max hits are 3 in his first form, 5 in his second, and 7 in his third. Although the fourth form is difficult, it is not impossible to defeat him; if he is defeated, the player will be rewarded with a rsrc6235. Koschei's last form has 255 rsrc65. A rsrc1129 can be an aid in killing the fourth form. When he hits, he always hits for 1 rsrc16130, but at a rate of 3-4 hits per second, and due to the rounding-up of the ring of recoil, would always hit him back for 1 at the same attack rate. Note, however, that a player would have to bring several rings of recoil, because each can only reflect 40 Hitpoints. Low-levelled players may find his third and fourth form rather difficult, so a rsrc5005 or rsrc485 is strongly advised, for it will provide a little protection (do not wear a rsrc4896, or you will most likely have to start over again if your Hitpoints get too low). There are certain rsrc17830 in Koschei's basement, such as the pillars of fire, or the many chasms in the ground. Players need only run quickly over to one side of a hole, and because Koschei only moves at a walking speed, players should be at one end of a hole long before he reaches the other end. However, do not stay in a safe spot for too long, or Koschei will disappear and you will have to fight him all over again. It is also strongly advised that players bring high-healing food, such as rsrc3982 or rsrc17789, as in his third and fourth form he hits progressively harder and quicker. Also, it appears that if you take too long fighting Koschei, he will simply disappear and you will have to start the challenge all over again. It is interesting to note that, if you manage kill him three times, decide to try and kill him a fourth time, but find yourself unable to, the trial will still be deemed as a success. Once your life points reach 1, the player will kneel down and be transported back to rsrc17955, still completing the trial. This is because the challenge is a test of bravery, not strength. You can talk to rsrc17956 about Koschei's history. It is possible to bring certain weapons into Koschei's chamber. If you bring in a rsrc3780 and a rsrc556, you can carve a rsrc5558 then and there. If you bring rsrc9710, rsrc7608, rsrc446, and a rsrc422, you can fletch a crossbow and then use it to safe-spot Koschei. You may also bring leather with a rsrc1935 and rsrc1923 to craft some rsrc4920. Note that if players die on his first, second, or third form, they will die a normal death and lose their items! Players can only die to his fourth form to get the vote!  Koschei has many traits (including the trait of being hard to kill) that are similar to that of the rsrc17957 of the same name. However, in this legend, Koschei's soul was in a needle, inside an egg, inside a duck, inside a hare, inside an iron chest, which was buried under a green oak tree, which is on the island of Buyan, in the ocean. The only way to defeat him was if the egg or the needle was broken, and in some legends it has to be done on Koschei's forehead. He has a rsrc1220 symbol on his chest. However, in which way he is, or was, related to the god is unknown, or, if he is just a supporter. However in rsrc16012, it is later revealed that he is one of the rsrc9686. Koschei's name is spelled \u041a\u043e\u0449\u0435\u0301\u0439 \u0411\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043c\u0435\u0301\u0440\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 (Kosch\u00e9i Bessm\u00e9rtny) in Russia where he is a popular figure in its folklore. As is usual in Russian transliterations, there are numerous other spellings. The spelling in other Slavic languages (like Polish \"Ko\u015bciej\", Czech \"Kost\u011bj\") suggests that his name may be derived from \"kost\" (rus. \u043a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c, pol. ko\u015b\u0107, cz. kost = bone); thus suggesting a skeleton-like appearance, which also indicates a possible connection with the Mahjarrat. He is the fastest attacking rsrc15930 in the game (in his final form with an attack speed of 9, meaning every 0.6 seconds), along with rsrc8539. The attack speed for his first three forms is exactly the same as unarmed combat. \"Koschei\" is also the name of \"The Master\", one of the antagonist in the famous British sci-fi Doctor Who. The Master displays an ability to \"regenerate\" more number of times than the other members of his species can, hence, in a way, he can also be considered \"deathless\". The first few \"faces\" of the Master include a beard and a moustache."

    "article-text": "Kraka is a level 91 rsrc2504 guarding rsrc5993. Since trolls are named after the first thing they ate, he probably ate a cracker (which would most likely be a reference to a rsrc1517). He has a maximum hit of 23, so it is recommended to use rsrc1264 when fighting him. Like the rest of the \"big, bad\" trolls in the area, such as rsrc653, rsrc657, and rsrc652, he may drop a rsrc7758 or rsrc4571. The level 69 and 71 trolls do not drop those two items, contrary to popular belief. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550.   Kraka's name is a reference to the word \"cracker\", likely referring to rsrc1517, which are a rsrc17959 in RuneScape, and contain rsrc4427. Trolls are named after what they first try to eat, so Kraka must have tried to eat a Christmas cracker, and Pee Hat, his troll counterpart and possible sibling, must have eaten the partyhat when it came out of the Christmas cracker."

    "article-text": "The Kraken is a stronger and larger version of the rsrc649. It requires level 87 rsrc285 to kill. Located at the rsrc7425, it can only be attacked if the player has cave krakens as a rsrc3482, which also requires level 50 rsrc59. Along with their rsrc649, they are the only monsters that drop the rsrc297. In addition to the tentacle, the Kraken is the only monster to drop the rsrc1354. Like its smaller brethren, the Kraken is submerged underwater. To start the fight, the four whirlpools around it must be disturbed; this will release a level 112 rsrc12052, which attacks with rsrc59. When all four whirlpools are disturbed, the larger one can be disturbed, which will result in the Kraken popping out. Both the Kraken and its tentacles attack with magic; the Kraken can hit very hard, but often misses, while the tentacles are much more accurate but deal less damage. The Kraken and its tentacles use rsrc10795 Magic and as such rsrc5495 does not prevent or reduce any damage they deal to the player (nor does it reduce their accuracy). The Kraken's projectile resembles rsrc855. Players can create a Kraken instance for 25,000 coins. The player does not need to carry coins on them to create the instance. The player does need to be careful in the instance though, as it only holds one player (the creator), and any items you drop will be permanently lost upon exiting, including those if you die or disconnect. Also if you log out after paying the coins, you will be kicked out of the boss room and will have to pay again. Items intentionally dropped on the floor within the Kraken boss instance will remain on the floor for 30 minutes; however, items are still lost on death. Items dropped in the regular cave will disappear as normal.   In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550.   Its examine text is a reference to rsrc17173: rsrc17962 and its sequel rsrc17963, as well as the rsrc7236 drop, and the rsrc295. Upon release, the Kraken did not have an option to create an instance. This was added on rsrc17964 on 19 March 2015. It uses the same in-game model as the rsrc12244 from the rsrc913 quest, but recoloured. During the rsrc2315 and rsrc3871, the Kraken, along with its pet counterpart, could be seen wearing a rsrc9197."

In order to reach the encampment, players must first wield any rsrc1687 along with a rsrc16000. A rsrc78 level of at least 70 is then required to navigate the chasm. To enter the boss room, players must have slain 40 followers of Armadyl, with aviansies and their spiritual variants being his only followers within the dungeon. Kree'arra can be seen yelling several battle cries in his chamber. However, unlike the other generals, his taunts are non-verbal. Like other God Wars Dungeon bosses, Kree'arra roams around a rectangular room with his bodyguards until a player enters, attacking them on sight. He attacks primarily with Ranged, and his bodyguards use a different combat style each. However, if no one is targeting Kree'arra, he will fly up to players to use Melee attacks as well. If all players leave, his health and stats will be reset. Like other Armadylian followers, he and his bodyguards cannot be attacked with Melee.  At rsrc1469s first rsrc124, players could speak to Kree'arra, resulting in the following dialogue: Player: Well.... Kree'Arra. I.. I.. Kree'arra: You what? Still confused about if I'm a he or a she? Still one of those guys who says 'Oh let's go kill Kree'Arra I bet SHE'LL drop us something good. I'm male alright.... geeze. Player: No no n... wait, really? Player: Damn. Anyway, no I wasn't expecting to see you and the others.... here? I thought you were all sworn enemies? Kree'arra: Yeah, well... we put aside our differences for the party since we're indebted to the development team for bringing us to life in the first place. Kree'arra: Although, I'm getting very annoyed with Graardor over there who just keeps eating everything he can find. Player: Well I hope you enjoy yourself and.... don't kill anyone? Kree'Arra looks at you glaringly. Player: Well.... Kree'Arra. I.. I.. Kree'arra: You what? Still confused about if I'm a he or a she?

He is involved in the rsrc47 quest, and players must talk to him before meeting rsrc16068 to make an alliance with him.

He also looks bigger than the other monkey ninjas.

Next, climb the ladder at the top of the cliff, cross the bridge, and go down the other ladder.

When being fought, Kruk will use all three rsrc10737: rsrc507, rsrc78 and rsrc59. Kruk's melee attack is very powerful, capable of hitting up to 30s. Can be rsrc16455 and killed without taking damage by rsrc10670 with melee. Lure Kruk to north then run to the south-west wall.

As none of the melee and ranged weapons can be poisoned, Kurask are immune to poisonous attacks. Their attacks are relatively inaccurate, but can hit somewhat high if they do. Although Kurask are invulnerable to any damage from the rsrc9228 and rsrc1695 special attacks, they will still heal the player as if it would have dealt damage, making them useful as special attack weapons during extended trips. These monsters, along with rsrc975, drop the rsrc3530. They are also known for their rsrc8224 and rsrc7433 drops, as well as being the only monster to drop the exclusive rsrc5414. 3 herbs are dropped at a time, in a manner similar to rsrc623 and rsrc707. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550.  The drop tables of the Kurask were improved with rsrc17908 on 15 September 2016."

They are particularly weak to rsrc59, thus making rsrc828 a slow but profitable method of killing them. Lava dragons can be rsrc17724 both inside and outside their isle. The many piles of skeletons and edges at the isle allow for players to safespot them inside. Alternatively, players can camp some of the southern spawns outside the isle, although they should be careful as rsrc1355 can walk to their safespot and attack the players. Having 74 rsrc505 and the hard rsrc5711 completed is recommended when killing them to use the stepping stones to escape the isle, as the area is frequented by rsrc518. Bringing a rsrc197 is optional to grind the scales into shards, in addition to rsrc8 runes to alch their common rsrc15899 and rsrc4588 drops. If killing them from outside the isle, rsrc789 will be needed to grab their drops. Although it is possible to stay at the isle indefinitely using this method, it is advisable to bank every 10-20 minutes as the isle is commonly targeted by rsrc518. Lava dragons are the only monsters to drop the rsrc3299, which give 85 rsrc81 rsrc19 when buried. However, burying them on Lava Dragon Isle grants 340 Prayer experience instead. Although they drop rsrc2718, they do not count as rsrc17966 for a rsrc16024. Two herbs are dropped when the herb table is rolled. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the standard rsrc550.  They were formerly rsrc605, but have spent too long surrounded by lava and have been transformed."

    "article-text": "Leon d'Cour is the Champion of Champions, and the last boss in the rsrc4279 minigame. He can only be fought after all the other champions have been slain. Upon defeating the last champion, Leon d'Cour will challenge the player, telling them \"You have done well brave adventurer, but I would test your mettle now. You may arrange the fight with Larxus at your leisure.\" The special rule in this fight is that the player cannot have any items in their rsrc424. Once players defeat Leon d'Cour, he will exclaim \"Adventurer, you have defeated me in battle! For this, I congratulate you. Please accept my cape as a sign of your accomplishment\", and give players the rsrc4276. Since no inventory items are allowed, players using rsrc507 should bring equipment with a high rsrc81 bonus such as rsrc6983 or rsrc1125 and activate rsrc1264 as the champion hits accurately and hard with melee. Leon is weak to rsrc59, however since runes cannot be brought to the fight, the only options to attack him using Magic are rsrc5180-class weapons or a rsrc2827. Leon d'Cour is a play on Coeur de Lion (French for Lionheart), which is a nickname of King Richard I Plantagenet of England for his reputation as a great military leader and warrior. The three golden lions on Leon d'Cour's platebody is also the sigil of the House of Plantagenet."

Lesser demons have a somewhat low rsrc30, allowing players to hit them almost constantly for rsrc19. The lesser demon is the sixth strongest monster in free-to-play, only beaten by the rsrc377 in the rsrc3405, the level 85 rsrc17968, rsrc619 in the rsrc464 and the bosses rsrc882 and rsrc611. Like most demons they are susceptible to the effects of rsrc2789, rsrc1324 and rsrc1321. Although combat experience per hour can be above average, lesser demons' sparse drops make them an average rsrc3482. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the rsrc16088.  On 29 August rsrc51, lesser demons were graphically updated, giving them a more distinguished look. Several graphical variations of lesser demons were added with this update, including making the one in rsrc6397 slightly taller than normal and giving him an extended green tongue."

The cooler will be consumed, so multiple coolers are necessary for slayer trips. They can be killed in place of rsrc4721 or rsrc4719 on a rsrc16024, and are found within the same area as the desert lizards. They will provide more experience on a task than desert lizards. Ice coolers must be used on them when they reach low health in order to kill them. If an ice cooler is accidentally used when the desert lizard has more than 10% of their hitpoints, it will still be used up but have no effect. Players would be wise to bring a few extra because of this. rsrc4379 (and a means of filling them, such as a Knife for cutting cacti or rsrc1996) should be brought to avoid dying in the desert due to rsrc2708. rsrc5299 may be useful if you can afford to fight without decent armour. rsrc59 attacks appear to be effective, particularly rsrc10525, although melee works well enough. These Lizards should be killed for the most experience, as they have more hitpoints. There are two that spawn due north-east of the fairy ring, almost at the edge of the map. They are each near a cactus. You can kill the first lizard, slash a cactus with knife, move to the second, kill lizard, slash cactus, repeat as needed. They drop rsrc2475, so more rsrc19 in Slayer, rsrc712, and rsrc81 is gained than with the smaller lizards. On the other hand, killing the smaller lizards allows you to complete your task more quickly. "

Dealing damage to Lizardmen, only attacked by Shayzien soldiers and not other players, will guarantee the favour. They can be unlocked as a rsrc285 task at a cost of 75 rsrc16253.

    "article-text": "Lizardman shamans are giant reptilian humanoids that are stronger than their normal rsrc16140 and rsrc7587 counterparts. They are often sought after for their rsrc2134 drops. They never become rsrc17809 to the player. Note that players are required to have 100% rsrc16718 with the rsrc5494 in order to kill lizardman shamans. Lizardman shamans can be found in two locations: Three shamans reside in the western area of rsrc3910, and is completely rsrc17973. Shayzien soldiers will not attack the shamans (nor will the shamans attack them), since they are busy dealing with a small group of rsrc16140. Below are a couple ways to get there. rsrc17974 are the fastest way to reach them. These three shamans are present in a rsrc17944. Players can check how many players are currently in the western area of the canyon by speaking to the rsrc17975 outside the canyon. Warning: The player should be wary if more than one shaman attacks them at a time as they can quickly stack up damage from their abilities and attacks, which can quickly end a trip. If the players do not want to be attacked constantly by the nearby lizardmen and their rsrc7587 forms, killing the ones in the north and south-west corners is recommended. Partial completion of rsrc4587 is required to use the rsrc4594. A fairy ring (code DJR) is nearby, just south of rsrc3910. Eight shamans reside inside a cave at the northern end of the rsrc7588 before rsrc13504. This is a rsrc5445 area. It has several rsrc15915 that it can utilise during the fight. Excluding the spawns, there is no cooldown so it is possible for a lizardman shaman to repeatedly use the same ability over and over again. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has a 1/25 chance to access the standard rsrc550. When the rsrc16353 was released, two shamans were added into the rsrc7588. Unlike the shamans at the rsrc3910, these did not require 100% rsrc16718. This led to backlash, as the rsrc5494 did not have many incentives to gain reputation. These shamans were eventually removed in favour of a rsrc3482 area on 13 July 2017. In the same update, safespots in the canyon were removed. On release, shamans could summon spawns in quick succession. This was changed in rsrc17735 on 8 February rsrc231."

They can temporarily lower a player's rsrc64 stat by 1 when they hit, but they cannot lower it further. They can also lower a player's rsrc28 stat by multiple points. Loar Shades are capable of floating over water and can climb onto bridges that have gaps in the fences. As they are undead, they are susceptible to the effects of rsrc825 and the rsrc1086. They are also extremely weak to the rsrc6341, although a rsrc639 deals more damage on average. These are commonly killed for the rsrc1312 rsrc3482 that is given by rsrc3738. The best way to get to these is by using a rsrc8099 or Shades of Mort'ton minigame teleport (requires completion of the quest rsrc1617). Alternatively get a Barrows Teleport Tab and run southwest. Safespot them using the stone stands found by the funeral pyres. "

The level 98 riders attack using somewhat slow rsrc78 attacks. The level 106 version uses a spear for rsrc507, and attacks faster than the rangers. The level 106 riders can hit a maximum of 25 hitpoints, and the level 98s can hit up to 22. Remember that you need to bring a light source when you are in the dungeon. Locust Riders are scattered throughout the dungeon. They frequently hit over 20, so rsrc14752 and good food are recommended, especially if multiple riders are encountered. The rsrc6342 Dagger special effect works against Locust Riders. Though not directly assigned, Locust Riders may be slain as part of a Scabarite assignment. These monsters respawn at an extremely fast rate, so it may be ideal to stay in one spot. A good strategy to kill these is to wear prayer-boosting armour, such as Proselyte armour and use Protect from Ranged. When your prayer gets low, go back up to Sophanem and recharge your prayer at the High Priest's altar. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the rsrc16088."

Unlike most other superior monsters, marble gargoyles use two combat styles: melee and ranged. Both its standard attacks can hit very high, though they are somewhat inaccurate. It is recommended to pray melee. In combat, the marble gargoyle will occasionally launch a grey ball towards the player. If hit by the projectile, it will inflict up to 38 damage and rsrc3080 the player for a few seconds. The message box states \"You have been trapped in stone!\" when this occurs. Players are able to avoid this attack by moving at least one rsrc9274 away from their original position once the projectile is launched. Marble gargoyles give 3 rolls on their regular counterpart's drop table. There is a 1 in 64.8 chance of rolling the unique drop table.  In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the standard rsrc550.  Originally, the marble gargoyle appeared simply as a recoloured gargoyle, and received a rsrc16285 on 23 February 2017, along with the rest of the rsrc5158. Despite this, it looked much like a standard gargoyle, apart from having a bit more detail on its wings. Its special attack also consisted of two squiggly purple lines resembling a rsrc6569's Magic attack, which were hard to see because they were small. However, the marble gargoyle received a more comprehensive graphical update (including unique animations) on 1 November 2017 as part of rsrc17986. This also changed the appearance of its binding projectile.

Be wary as these monsters are extremely powerful. Their release broke the rsrc616's long-standing record as being the strongest dragon in rsrc15920. It is strongly recommended to use rsrc1457 in conjunction with an rsrc1391 (or a rsrc1394) when fighting these along with the appropriate protection rsrc81. The ability to be assigned mithril dragons can be purchased for 80 rsrc293. Once unlocked, they can be disabled, but players must spend another 80 points to unlock them again. Players also must have entered the Ancient Cavern at least once to get mithril dragons as a rsrc16024. rsrc274 rsrc16096 offer to convince mithril dragons to drop their bars in noted form while on a slayer assignment, for a cost of 200 slayer points. If they are fought without complete rsrc1395 protection, it is recommended to stay in melee range and use rsrc1264, to reduce the amount of dragonfire damage taken. Mithril dragons can be found on the top level of the Ancient Cavern. Note that rsrc984 are not allowed in the Ancient Cavern. To access the Ancient Cavern, one must have completed the first part of rsrc17987 training and then talked to rsrc17988 about pyre ships. After the conversation is over, the player can now go in the whirlpool. Upon entering, one must climb down stairs and then run south to a set of stairs leading up to the mithril dragons.   Prior to the release of rsrc230, mithril dragons were brighter in colour. Their old appearance was given to rsrc4296 to make them appear more like the metals' true colours."

    "article-text": "Molanisks are rsrc6905 that require level 39 rsrc285 to kill giving 52 Slayer rsrc19 per kill. A rsrc9536 is necessary to fight them. Players should remember to bring a rsrc3390 when fighting them, as they are only found underground. Despite what their level would suggest, Molanisks do unusually low damage, meaning a relatively mid-level player with half-decent rsrc4920 should easily be able to kill several of them. Molanisks are found attached to cave walls and must be lured off with a rsrc9536 to allow players to attack them. When lured off the wall, they are rsrc10611 towards the player who lured them off with the bell. Molanisks rsrc3840 relatively quickly, so players who want to conserve rsrc1874 can just stay at the same respawn location. Bringing a rsrc761 allows for a quicker task. Molanisks have a low maximum hit and their attacks aren't very accurate, however their hits can mount up. Therefore, a small amount of rsrc184 is recommended up to rsrc30 level 80 for larger tasks (over 100). An alternative would be picking up rsrc2071 and using the rsrc2062 or rsrc3315 spell. Due to their maximum hit being so low, level 40 Defence and rsrc14796 or rsrc14797 is sufficient. Molanisks are relatively weak to both rsrc5634 and rsrc59 attacks. Molanisks can only be rsrc16428 on certain rocks, notably the large one down the path south of the rsrc4594. If you are getting attacked by another monster, for example a rsrc17992, and then use the Slayer bell, the Molanisk will attack you and the monster initially attacking you will lose its aggression. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550. "

Monks will heal a few of a player's rsrc65 if the player talks to them and asks them to do so. Monks are useful for training on at lower combat levels, as players can talk to another monk and request healing. Monks will also heal themselves at random intervals in combat, resulting in more experience per kill. Because monks can survive small amounts of damage, it's possible for a rsrc299 to train on the same monk indefinitely. The largest group of monks is found the monastery north-east of the entrance to the rsrc16193. rsrc375 players often visit the monastery to heal due to a lack of high-tier food and prayer potions.  It is possible to have a monk heal you after you kill him, as long as you begin a conversation after you have dealt the killing blow before he dies. Also, you can be healed while someone else is fighting the monk. Monks can heal themselves 2 HP instead of attacking you. Contrary to the popular belief, monks don't cure poison when they heal you. Monks heal 30% of your HP when asked to, using the Option \"Talk-to\". However, other players prefer to speak to Abbot Langley, even though he heals exactly the same amount of health. Male characters can look exactly like a monk by wearing rsrc17993 and having a shaved head hairstyle along with brown boots from rsrc11134 if they don't already have them. At one point, a hidden update gave players a small amount of Prayer XP for killing a monk, however this was quickly reversed. Due to unknown reasons, it is now possible for one of the monks to refuse to heal you, despite that they would always automatically heal you in the past without even saying anything in response."

They are found in several locations, including the rsrc10336, rsrc2922 and rsrc782. A caged level 17 monk of zamorak on the ground floor of rsrc5244 is often used in free-to-play servers to train rsrc59 using the rsrc3184 rsrc16633. Despite them being feared they are extremely useful for rsrc10702 as they are weak towards rsrc78 and there are many safe spots. It is also a useful spot because there is an altar located in the temple for rsrc81. One under the radar spot where there are only melee-only combat is directly in the rsrc8916 rsrc13162 near the rsrc222. You must defeat a level 30 for completion of rsrc2265. They are frequently fought on F2P worlds due to the price of their drops."

    "article-text": "Monkey Guards are level 167 gorillas that reside in the rsrc7700, found on rsrc1256. They reside on the ground1st floor[?] and 1st2nd floor[?] of rsrc1256's rsrc7700. They have a large amount of health and throw vicious punches that can hit up to 14. When they have very low health, they will beat their chest, causing them to heal 25 hitpoints which is about 20% of their rsrc65; they appear to be able to do this indefinitely but only while in melee range. Monkey Guards drop larger versions of monkey bones, which give 18 prayer experience points when buried. However, these are not tradeable. The bearded monkey guards can be a nuisance because they cannot be walked through, and after exiting the dungeon in the temple, bearded monkey guards can surround you, stopping you from exiting the temple. A way out of this is to climb up the ladder near the trapdoor. There is a way, however, to kill the Monkey Guards (including bearded variants) using melee as a player with relatively low combat stats. Monkey Guards can be brought down to 26-35 HP by normal attacks. The player can then poison the Monkey Guard using a rsrc17994 or other super poisoned weapon. Once the Monkey Guard is poisoned, and before the Monkey Guard heals, the player can run out of range of the poisoned Monkey Guard, and wait for the poison damage to finish him off. The southwestern corner of the Monkey Guard temple is a good place to poison and safe-spot one of the Monkey Guards as there is a ladder that the player can hide behind. Because the Monkey Guards heal themselves and because there is an altar in the temple, many players train combat of all forms on them by fighting them with rsrc1264 and stat boosting prayers on the whole time. The only downside to this method is their very high defence. When they are low on rsrc81, they pray at the altar and continue their training. The Monkey Guards also heal themselves often, providing more experience, but making it difficult to kill them for their bones. Most players wear a form of Prayer armour and strength boosting armour (depending on what they prefer). However, prayer isn't needed that badly because of the nearby altar. rsrc17995 here used to be a popular activity, but it is much more advisable to do this at rsrc238 instead. It is wise to have multiple antipoisons or use rsrc233, in case the nearby level 1 rsrc3308 poisons you (poison hits for 1). "

    "article-text": "Monkey Guards will appear if players talk to a monkey on rsrc1256 while in human form. One or two of these may appear along with one of the named ninja monkeys. The named monkeys are rsrc8058, rsrc16616, rsrc16617, rsrc16618, rsrc17997, rsrc17998 and rsrc17999. Unlike the named ninja monkeys, they only drop small ninja monkey bones, which can also be obtained from killing the abundant rsrc8059. If they hit the player, the player will appear in the Ape Atoll prison, making it tricky to kill these. Instead of killing these yourself, they can be killed for small monkey ninja bones by walking in monkey form on the trapdoor in the warehouse, then quickly taking the rsrc3318 off and waiting for them to appear. If rsrc8269 notices them, he will kill them instantly. If he does not kill them all, simply re-equip the greegree and the monkey guards will disappear when they try to attack you. Afterwards, equip your greegree and pick up the bones. Players could also kill them by getting them stuck behind an obstacle. rsrc8054's hut is perfect for this, as when players talk to Solihib in human form, the guards are often stuck behind a jungle plant, and players can safely kill them with rsrc78 or rsrc59. However, the player should have decent stats and be quick as they disappear after a while. For player with a high combat level, killing them directly may be easier as Karam does not always notice them and he himself gets stuck on obstacles often."

They drop rsrc3293 that are needed to make a rsrc18001. Level 129s and level 82s can be found rsrc8064 where Monkey Guards are located.

There are also level 98 zombie monkeys located in the inaccessible room under the rsrc18002 (accessible after the rsrc18003 is complete). They are also located in the cave with rsrc2669. Monkey zombies appear to be green undead monkeys. If you have a high enough rsrc81 and combat level, these monsters can be used for training. One can get around 100k experience per hour at higher levels. Use prayer, and when you are out run upstairs and use the altar. Make sure, however, to become a monkey using a rsrc3318 or you will be trapped by the larger monkeys up the ladder. An alternative to training here would be to bring rsrc18004 and use rsrc1044, getting rid of the need to go upstairs and avoid the monkey guards.

While some monsters will never begin a fight with a player, many high level creatures are rsrc16139, potentially causing unwanted death. If a player has over double the rsrc173 of the monster, the monster will be docile, and will only attack when provoked. However, in areas such as the rsrc464, most monsters are indefinitely aggressive. As a rule of thumb, \"humanoids\" are not aggressive towards players except in some cases when the humanoid's nature or occupation has malign or criminal connotations (i.e. rsrc2628, rsrc3711, rsrc6139).

He is known to be very arrogant in his ways, claiming physical strength to be the determining factor in a troll's ability to lead, and consistently berates his advisor, rsrc11713, for speaking grammatically correct English and making rather useless inventions; the only time he praised him was when Odd Mushroom presented him the Fire of Domination. He had set up an arranged marriage for Snowflake and rsrc11697, his strongest sentry. After being tricked by the player, rsrc6599, rsrc11705, rsrc11713 and the rsrc3109, he plans on killing them all. He manages to mortally wound Odd Mushroom, who succumbs to his injuries later, and Mother is eventually killed by the rest of the group. After his death, Snowflake takes over as the leader of Weiss. During the fight against Mother, he has the Fire of Domination lit up, which makes him massively powerful and immune to any damage. In order to hurt Mother, players must take a rsrc1997 and use it on the large barrel of water to extinguish the Fire. He is able to launch boulders towards the player, which can hit through rsrc7104. He will also knock players backwards, draining their rsrc16116. "

As a side note, use caution when fighting the level 11 mourners as they will drain all your rsrc712 stats (including rsrc65) to 20 when attacked. The level 108 Mourners located in the basement of the rsrc18010 are considered as rsrc714, so their stats and drop table is the same as an Elf warrior, with the exception of ensouled heads and seeds, and they will also count towards an elf slayer task.

Like regular bloodvelds, a mutated bloodveld's attacks are rsrc18012. They are known to damage frequently due to their high attack level, so equipping armour with high Magic defence is highly recommended to mitigate their attacks. They can also be rsrc16428 with ease. Alternatively, players can opt to wear rsrc18004 while using the rsrc1264 prayer, using rsrc1044 instead of food. Players can also teleport to an altar and then teleport back to the Catacombs instead of using prayer potions, since these bloodvelds are so close to the entrance. Mutated bloodvelds are popular for players willing to spend time completing their task, as they provide better experience than normal bloodvelds. They also drop more rsrc1137 at a higher rate compared to normal bloodvelds, in addition to the universal rsrc1311 and rsrc4516 pieces most monsters drop in the Catacombs.

While this smaller muttadile is alive, the larger one will stay submerged in the water, where it is unattackable and attacks players with rsrc59 (which covers the whole chamber). rsrc3014 and rsrc17874 are recommended for the small muttadile. When the smaller muttadile dies, the larger one emerges from the water and starts attacking the player. Apart from having higher stats and using all three forms of rsrc712, this larger muttadile will also perform a shockwave attack if anyone is within melee range, dealing massive damage to them. It is important to stay away from melee distance of the larger muttadile and utilise rsrc18013, which are found near the entrance in a corner, a bit north of the meat tree, or in the corner close to where the muttadile emerged from the water, to ensure the muttadile will only use Magic and Ranged on the team. When fighting the large muttadile, rsrc5495 is recommended. As the muttadiles' health lowers, they will go to the nearby rsrc13856 and start eating it to replenish health. Players can use rsrc2988 or rsrc10459 special attack to stop them from going to the tree. Alternatively, players can cut down the meat tree. Another method is to simply let the muttadile replenish its health, as it stops trying to eat the tree after it has done so several times. Using this method yields higher points, but more damage taken.  The word 'Muttadile' is a portmanteau of mutt, mutant and crocodile. The strange bells near the entrance have the examine text \"for whom?\" which could be a reference to the 1940 novel For whom the bell tolls by Ernest Hemingway."

The number of Nail beasts that players encounter depends on the difficulty of the path being taken and can range from anywhere between two level 60 beasts (easy) and six level 140 beasts (hard). On an easy event, players will see between two and three Nail beasts, on a medium event they will see between three and four, and on a hard event anywhere between four and six will appear. They are not very strong, but they hit 3 times every attack (3 times in 7 rsrc18014) and are very accurate, even against high-defence armour. Players should keep an eye on their follower's hitpoints and on their own.  Prayer will not block the second or third attack if the first attack hits the player."

They are found only in the rsrc2865 (their stronger variant, rsrc560, can be found in the rsrc1323). Nechryaels are known for their rsrc6443 drop, which are one of the few boots to provide a rsrc305 when worn. They are also known for their frequent drop rates of rsrc1024 and combat rsrc884. Commonly, Nechryaels summon rsrc10792 to aid them, up to a limit of two each per Nechryael. Death spawns have semi-inaccurate attacks with a max hit of 2, and their attacks can hit through rsrc1264. rsrc17667 does not work on them, so you will have to click the death spawn to attack it. Death spawns will not be summoned if the Nechyrael is unable to attack the player back (such as when being rsrc17724). rsrc1324 can be very effective against Nechryael, as they are considered to be demonic creatures. Players cannot use a rsrc984 to kill Nechryaels anywhere. There is also a stronger variant of the monster called the Greater Nechryael located in the Catacombs of Kourend. They will count towards your rsrc3482 if you have been given Nechryaels as a task. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the standard rsrc550.  The model of the nechryael has an inverted pentagram on its chest, this orientation is considered a symbol of evil and is associated with the triumph of matter over spirit. The nechryael used to have similar drops to other monsters like rsrc18016, rsrc253, and rsrc619. Their drop table was revamped with the rsrc5158 update on 15 September 2016."

Like nechryaels, Nechryarchs can summon minions to assist it in battle. It will summon 3 rsrc10794, with each one attacking with magic, ranged and melee. Given the fact that the chaotic spawns are more damaging, a common method is to run away when the chaotic spawns appear, and return to attack the Nechryarch when they lose interest. The player can also kill them, though this is only useful when bursting or barraging greater nechryaels. Like their standard counterparts, the chaotic death spawns will not be summoned if the Nechryarch is unable to attack the player back (such as when being rsrc16428). Any chaotic death spawns that the Nechryarch summons will despawn when its host is killed. Nechryarchs give 3 rolls on their regular counterpart's drop table. There is a 1 in 54.2 chance of rolling the unique drop table. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550.  Their in-game models resemble and they use the same animations as rsrc17670, similarly to rsrc5607. They are the only superior slayer monster that spawns for both their normal and stronger counterparts."

    "article-text": "Normal Hard Echned Zekin                                               Nezikchened is a level 187 rsrc843 that has to be defeated three different times during the rsrc192. He is also among the strongest demons in the game. At the start of each fight he drains a player's prayer points. Like all demons, he is also vulnerable to the effects of rsrc2789, rsrc1321, rsrc1324, and rsrc2534. He has a very peculiar habit of calling the player 'Vacu'. According to the Shaman rsrc190 'Vacu' was the name for the evil priests who served the 'demons of the underworld'. Despite being a black demon, he is not considered one for the purpose of a rsrc3482. He can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete, but will not drain prayer points there. Nezikchened has possessed rsrc190, the shaman of the rsrc2948. Players must use the book of binding on him to reveal his true form. He will then drain the player's prayer and use melee on them. He can be easily defeated if they drink a prayer potion and then use protect from melee. Stabbing him with Silverlight, Darklight, or throwing a vial of holy water at him can weaken him. This is thought to be the easiest of Nezikchened's three phases, as it is very predictable and only one prayer will be needed. Nezikchened appears again disguised as the ghost Echned Zekin, an anagram for Nezikchened, and will ask players to kill the spirit rsrc3100. Players who do so will save time but will have to fight rsrc4438, rsrc4435, and rsrc4436 at the final part of the quest. Players who do not kill Viyeldi will not have to face these foes, and will receive a rsrc5133 card from rsrc190, which also will weaken him. Whichever path they choose, when players return to Echned Zekin, he will turn into Nezikchened and fight the player. This time he drains the player's prayer unless they use the holy force spell card on him. He uses a weak magic attack at first, then switches to melee. This fight is relatively similar to the first one, in terms of difficulty. At the end of the quest, players must fight the demon one last time. He uses a powerful magic attack and melee, and again he drains prayer at the beginning. A possible way to defeat him involves drinking a prayer potion, using protect from magic, and hiding in the trees with a ranged weapon. If players chose the \"short\" route during the quest, he will also spawn rsrc4438, rsrc4435 and rsrc4436 one at a time in an attempt to weaken the player. After the player has delivered the final blow to Nezikchened, he will exclaim \"I am beaten by a mere mortal...I will revenge myself upon you!\" and the player automatically and sarcastically responds \"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Heard it all before\" right before Nezikchened bursts into flames and dies as he burns into ashes. Nezikchened uses two attacking styles; melee if you are close-up and a black magical attack from a distance. The demon is somewhat resistant to magic and ranged. If a player takes too long to kill him, he will teleport away, forcing you to restart the battle. Melee attacks with a dragon weapon and protect from melee turned on work well in dispatching him quickly. Some prayer potions are necessary to fight Nezikchened because he will reduce your prayer points to around a tenth of whatever prayer points you have remaining. Nezikchened has the ability to hit through protect from melee, however, the chance of this happening is so low, it will probably occur only once during the quest. It is recommended the player keep their life points above 20 at all times. For battle 1: Nezikchened uses his prayer drain in only one hit, and it is at the beginning. You will still have enough prayer points to use protect from melee for a few seconds, and those are the seconds to use your prayer potions. His defence, which is the only combat stat that matters if you use prayer, is not very high. Battle 2: Some players have reported that the demon doesn't even use his magic attack at all in the fight. Even if he does, it will only be 1-2 attack, so protect from melee can be used throughout the battle, as long as you have a little food. If the player fights Nezikchened from a distance while protecting from magic, he may throw a dagger (if the player took the short route and used the obsidian dagger) which may do some amount of damage, although there is a chance the player will dodge this attack. Assuming he uses the attack, the demon will only throw the dagger once throughout the course of the fight. Battle 3: This is the hardest battle. Initially, Nezikchened gets a few free strikes at you and he will also attack when the player is helpless during the intermissions between each warrior (if the short route was taken) but these strikes can be negated with protect from melee. After that, if you are using melee, he won't even bother using magic, so protect from melee can be held. However, the one time that Nezikchened usually hits through protect from melee tends to be in this last battle. "

It changes its combat style throughout the fight by changing its carapace - blue for magic, green for ranged and white for melee, which is also its weakness. Attacking it with the wrong combat style will cause it to reflect the hit back towards the player as well as healing from the hit.  The latter part of the name of the Nylocas Vasilias likely derives from the Greek term \"\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac\u03c2\"(transliterated, \"basilias\"), meaning \"king\" or \"royal\". Thus, the Nylocas Vasilias may also be understood to be a King Nylocas - a name likely intended to lend credence to its lore and offer insight pertaining to its place in the Nylocas hierarchy - deserving of its role as a boss encounter. After rsrc16395 on 21 June 2018 removing the earlier waves of nylocas, the hitpoints of the Nylocas Vasilias was increased from 2000 to 2500, its rsrc17799 from 400 to 600, and its rsrc16328, rsrc469 and rsrc18019 bonus from 40 to 60, 60 and 600, respectively. This also increased its max hit from 58 to 70, as well as being able to hit harder through protection prayers."

    "article-text": "Obor, the Hill Titan, is the hill giant rsrc1708 residing in his lair, located in the locked gates found at the western wall of the hill giant area in the rsrc3317. In order to access Obor's Lair, the player must obtain a rsrc6420 from a rsrc1329 or rsrc372. Each giant key permits for only one attempt, similar to rsrc716 and rsrc4516. When the player first enters Obor's Lair, they will be in a safe zone, where they must climb down the rocks in order to fight him. Obor attacks with rsrc507 and rsrc78, and can detect whether the player is using rsrc7104 against his current attack style. For example, he will use ranging attacks if rsrc1264 is used. Warning: If you die within the lair, there is absolutely no way for you to retrieve items lost on rsrc2672! An easy strategy for lower-level players (with 50 rsrc18020rsrc59 and 40 rsrc18021rsrc81) is to always turn on the rsrc3014 prayer BEFORE climbing down, and then using rsrc8122 to prevent Obor from reaching you. Cast Snare every time Obor is able to walk again. Use Magic to kill him, since your rsrc16054's bonuses will also increase your chances of a successful rsrc8122 cast. Even with this strategy, however, bring enough food, as Obor can do serious damage as soon as the Snare wears off. rsrc18022 can attempt the same strategy using rsrc8124, but since that only immobilises Obor for half the amount of time, it will be much harder to do this successfully. However, if you bind him, run away, cast two rsrc4293 and repeat, you should still have a good chance with Protect from Missiles activated. It can be useful to know that Obor does not always keep walking up to rsrc507 distance before attacking, but never attacks when unable to move. This means he might stop walking towards you before standing next to you, giving you the time to snare or bind him without having to run to the other side of the arena. This makes it easier to cast more spells in a shorter amount of time, making the fight more efficient. The Hill Titan's name, Obor, translates to 'Giant' in the rsrc18023. Obor was originally suggested by Reddit user Mjterp. The post can be found rsrc18024"

If players talk to them, engage them in combat or set up a rsrc984 nearby, they will become aggressive and unleash their powerful counter-attack, hitting over 20, hence it is inadvisable to do so. Although this attack is Magic-based, it cannot be blocked with rsrc5495. If an ogre shaman is talked to, it will attack once with a Magic-based attack. Interestingly, the dragon killed by the shaman has a combat level of only 27. According to the examine text, the dragon is a mother dragon, like other blue dragons, and when it attacks with dragonfire, it immediately takes 30 points of damage, causing the dragon to have a total of 105 hitpoints.

Orks can be found in the rsrc467, in the army of rsrc1273. These Orks are notable as the most reliable soldiers in the army of Bandos, as they can hit up to 12 health points. Players should also beware that if they kill an Ork, all nearby Orks will become aggressive to the player. Also, if players have dealt damage to an ork which is eventually slain by other monsters, the orks around would still become aggressive. The strength of the ancient Orks is unusual, but all the recently-thawed combatants in the dungeon are stronger than their modern versions. It is unknown if they truly worship Bandos as their patron god, were forced into service like the rsrc873, or simply fight out of entertainment rather than loyalty or necessity. Orks also appear at a certain point in rsrc18027. The rsrc8786 is trying to replace the rsrc4615 and the rsrc2166 with Orks. Some of these Orks have no shown level, and some are level 20, but neither type can be attacked. They can be talked to, but all they say is \"Grunt! Smelly, stinky human! Urgh! Leave us alone before we hurt you.\" Orks are good for training melee at high levels. One should bring prayer potions and pray protect from melee while fighting them, and restore prayer as necessary. They will continue to be aggressive after you have slain an Ork. Despite their high combat level, orks only drop lower level combat metals such as bronze, iron, and occasionally steel. However, they do drop level 1 & 3 clue scrolls. "

Paladins will attack players that they catch trying to steal from the rsrc9480, rsrc5779, and rsrc9649, but will, if nearby, also attack a player if they attempt to talk to the owner of a stall recently stolen from by the respective player. A good strategy when training on Paladins is by using rsrc1264 then restoring your prayer points by the nearby rsrc5869. Keep repeating the process to prevent any excessive health loss. Healing using food stolen from nearby stalls is also an alternative. Paladins are weak to rsrc59 and Crush attacks. "

A good strategy to kill them is to stand 2 steps south of the entrance, and kill one after the other. the only problem with this is that when you go to pick up your drop from Pee Hat you will be attacked by several thrower trolls. However, this can be avoided by casting the rsrc789 spell. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550.   The name \"Pee Hat\" is a reference to rsrc4427, which are colloquially known by players as \"P-hats\". Since Trolls are named after the first thing they try to eat, Pee Hat is likely to have eaten a partyhat.

    "article-text": "The Pestilent Bloat is the second encounter in the rsrc1573. It was created by a crazy rsrc2317 known as \"The Butcher\" upon rsrc1574's request. According to a book titled rsrc18031, the Bloat was created by using three giant heads, an rsrc2480's corpse, four rsrc1997 of human blood, two rsrc15973 arms, two rsrc599 legs, an rsrc1537 and a sense of pride. The bloat will walk around its room in a square as soon as the party enters the room. If any player is within its line of sight, the Bloat's flies will attack them, causing players to take rapid hits of 10-20 every rsrc18014 until they are out of the Bloat's line of sight. This will spread to other players in the raid also and can therefore kill a party very quickly. After seven or fourteen cycles of mutilated flesh falling from the ceiling, it will stop moving, allowing players to attack it. After a few seconds, it will stomp the surrounding area, dealing large amounts of damage. If a player is hit by a mutilated flesh, it will deal 30-50 damage and stun them temporarily. Falling flesh can be evaded beforehand by looking for their shadow on the floor. The bloat will also change direction randomly throughout the fight. Along with this, it will also change the speed at which it is walking. It has 3 different speeds of walking.  Upon release, the Pestilent Bloat's falling flesh attack would fall so quickly that it was nearly impossible to dodge. The falling flesh were changed to fall one rsrc1473 slower in a hotfix on 8 June 2018, and was made another tick slower in rsrc16395 on 21 June 2018, with their shadows increasing in size as they approach the ground."

They are generally hated by players, as they make any location much more difficult to survive in. The level 31 variant may be encountered during the rsrc1831 when searching chests for the rsrc6507. These creatures pose a threat to players during the rsrc9 quest during the battle with rsrc4958. "

When fighting Porazdir, it can use a special attack that will fire a ball of energy at the player that can hit through rsrc7104 for upwards of 30 rsrc18035. When it uses this attack a message in the rsrc18036 will state Porazdir fires a ball of energy directly linked to his power!

Thus, they are common animals found throughout rsrc15920, typically rsrc173 1 or 3. Although many rats have no drops, the level 1 rats in the rsrc3405 have a 100% chance to drop rsrc2071. Considered by most players to be the weakest rsrc597 in the game, rats possess only 2 rsrc65, 8 total rsrc19, 0 rsrc30, and a max hit and rsrc28 accuracy of 1. Rats are quite literally half as strong as rsrc18045. Rats are looked upon fondly by most players, being the first monster any player defeats. rsrc3738 of rsrc3645 sets the task of slaying a rat or rsrc4850 to every new player. Rats rsrc17235 after half a game tick, the fastest respawn rate in the game. Rats appear in many dungeons and sewers throughout rsrc3096, and due to their weakness and commonness, rats are not marked on the rsrc8743. A similar critter, the level 1 rsrc3308, shares the same stats as the rat. When rsrc403 were first introduced, rats had an extremely low chance of dropping an rsrc1933. This was later changed so that rats never drop clue scrolls. The rat was one of the first entities ever added to RuneScape, being the fifth behind rsrc11743, rsrc873, rsrc18046, and rsrc18047. Its larger counterpart, the giant rat, soon followed. Players who have a rsrc1625 or a kitten can tell it to chase vermin, in which case it will try to attack any rat in range. If your cat catches at least 100 rats, you can go to rsrc4221 to get a rsrc4219 (no special bonuses). Also, if you have a rsrc8819, a rat will be added to it each time a rat is caught by your cat. The catch rate of rats are as follows:"

Although they do not attack the rsrc14390 directly, they are capable of tearing down the gates and barricades with just a few swipes of their claws, giving rsrc15409 and rsrc15411 a clearer shot at the Void Knight. As such, they must be killed as quickly as possible to protect the Void Knight from the torchers and defilers. Ravagers are non-aggressive, and have low defence and attack. However, they have high strength and thus can hit quite hard for their levels, so rsrc1264 is advised if targeting them. Their combat levels can be 36, 53, 71, 89, or 106 and their colouring is based on these levels. When attacked, a ravager will often continue destroying a nearby gate or barricade (if any) before engaging in combat with the attacking player, and may also destroy anything nearby that gets repaired, and are the second priority to kill.

The rsrc18051 and rsrc1939 that they drop are worth substantial amounts of money, but red dragons are rarely killed as they are only found in two locations: rsrc3524 (which requires 875 rsrc321, an rsrc3514, and 30 rsrc505 to access) and the western side of rsrc18052 beneath the rsrc3068 (which requires the completion of the Grandmaster quest rsrc230 to access). The ability to be assigned red dragons can be purchased for 50 rsrc293. Once unlocked, they can be disabled, but players must spend another 50 points to unlock them again. Killing rsrc620 in the rsrc1323 will also count toward a red dragon task. After completing the rsrc18053, red dragons in Brimhaven Dungeon will drop noted red dragonhides when killed. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550.   Red dragons formerly inhabited the Red Dragon Isle (now rsrc2699) in the rsrc464, but they were replaced with rsrc363 in the rsrc18054 update (in canon, this transformation was due to the fact that they had been living surrounded by lava for a very long time). Red dragons are the rarest type of chromatic dragon."

He is significantly taller than an ordinary rsrc2859 and appears to be wearing armour resembling rsrc5085, and wields a unique rsrc972 which resembles an rsrc319. During a cutscene, Robert is seen slaying one of the Dragonkin in their castle after it kills his pet panther, rsrc13501. The quest also reveals that rsrc16013 is the reincarnation of Robert the Strong. To help Bob the Cat remember his previous life as Robert the Strong, the player is tasked with defeating the latter after entering the cat's mind. His damage is only partially reduced by rsrc3014. He is then seen without his helmet during a cutscene. Here, it is revealed what Robert did with the key pieces the player is required to find.  Robert the Strong's Strong Arrow special attack is a nod to rsrc17461's Soul Blast during rsrc17462 in rsrc16188. His mannerisms also pay homage to Nomad. The name Robert the Strong could be a reference to the character Ser Robert Strong from George R.R Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire. Aside from the similar name, both characters are extraordinarily tall."

In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550. "

Unlike most other enemies and rsrc6277, Rock Crabs are not marked with yellow dots on the player's rsrc8743; this is probably due to the crabs' appearance, which camouflages them as rocks. Players can tell if a rock is a Rock Crab by looking at the rock's shape; Rock Crabs are tall oval shaped while normal rocks in their area are mostly in large clusters of shattered pieces. Another way to tell is by right clicking on them. If the text colour is yellow, it is a Rock Crab. If the text is blue, it is just a prop. Rock Crabs become docile if the player has not left the surrounding area in a certain amount of time (roughly between ten and twenty-five minutes). To make the crabs aggressive again, exit the surrounding area (halfway to the entrance to the village in rsrc678, or by entering and exiting the entrance to rsrc672) and enter again. You can also find one Rock Crab that will be aggressive, kill it then you can continue killing other crabs. As they are \"dormant\" until \"awoken\" by a passing player, rock crabs cannot be attacked until they are made aggressive once more. Rock Crabs are excellent for training at all rsrc173 due to their low rsrc30 and high rsrc65, though low level players should consider bringing rsrc184. Rock Crabs used to be a popular rsrc2114 monster until the release of rsrc4184, and the subsequent release of rsrc4091, which are now more preferred options for training. CAUTION: rsrc984 may be used here, unlike with the other types of crabs commonly used for training, This makes training for other players difficult. There is, however, a way to avoid the cannon's fire. If a player moves to the west-most part of the rsrc17973 zone, most cannon fire can be avoided. There are three rock crab spawns near this location, which makes it a decent spot. Although the cannon's fire can be avoided, it is best to switch to another world when faced with overcrowding. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the rsrc16088. "

Rockslugs can only be successfully killed with a rsrc1954, or by the use of a rsrc3528. If the bag of salt is accidentally used before the Rockslug is reduced to less than 5 rsrc65, it will still be used up but have no effect. It would be wise to bring a few extra because of this (or you buy \"Slug salter\" from a rsrc1956). If a Rockslug's health is reduced to 1 but a bag of salt is not used on it, the Rockslug will stop retaliating and wander off, which will not count as a kill, unless you or someone else uses a bag of salt on it, in which case whoever dealt the most damage to it will get the kill.

    "article-text": "Rune dragons are rsrc17351 first encountered during rsrc230, in which the player must fight against one during rsrc1237's assault. After completion of the quest, they can be found in the eastern chamber of the rsrc5487. To get back to the laboratory underneath rsrc926, players can travel using the rowboat from the quest or, after completion, taking a rsrc4462 and using it on the strange machine north of the rune dragon room, adding a teleport straight to rsrc926 on it. Rune dragons are the result of a side project of rsrc1237's after being inspired by another rsrc1234, rsrc17679, which involves infusing rsrc1694 eggs with various metals. While Forcae's metal dragons were created to find a solution to the dragonkin's infertility, Zorgoth had bred his metal dragons for his rsrc11781. At 99 rsrc289, players can add rsrc11611 to their rsrc156 rsrc5541 for 25,000,000 coins. Rune dragons have multiple attacks, similar to rsrc1285 and rsrc607. Along with standard rsrc1395 attacks, they have a standard rsrc507, rsrc78 and rsrc59 attack (which resembles rsrc842), as well as two special attacks. The first attack is two small electric bolts, which are launched around the player's position and homes in on them. This deals 4-7 damage per tick for a few seconds. If a player is wearing rsrc7115 this damage is reduced to 1-2 per tick. Players can avoid the attack entirely by running four to five squares away from their original position when the attack was launched. The second attack is a Ranged attack that hits through rsrc3014, and uses the Life Leech effect from rsrc5772, where the dragon will heal itself for 100% of the damage dealt to the player.  Upon release, rune dragons had a 1/3 chance of their dragon bones drop being replaced by rsrc3288. This was removed from their drop table in rsrc16122 on 25 January 2018 as part of a balancing change."

He can be found at the end of the dungeon, in an area that requires level 67 rsrc505 to enter (64 with an rsrc772 or 62 with a rsrc4581). He is currently one of only three rsrc16751 able to drop the rsrc6776, alongside the rsrc1119 and the rsrc1357. This key opens the rsrc6743 that contains nine rsrc16793: 2 rsrc2909, 3 rsrc5228, 1 rsrc18066, 1 rsrc6595, 1 rsrc1886, and 1 rsrc1471. Salarin is a target for many players because of this drop. Players should keep in mind that the Sinister key is an uncommon drop. Salarin can only be harmed by rsrc11171: rsrc859, rsrc868, rsrc864, and rsrc881. rsrc507 and rsrc78 cannot harm him. These spells will always deal 9, 10, 11, and 12 damage (respectively) to him as long as the player does not splash. This damage is not affected by items that would normally increase spell damage like the rsrc1345, rsrc57, rsrc3995, etc. This also means that Salarin could be a cheap way of training rsrc59 because you are guaranteed 23.5, 27.5, 31.5, and 35.5 Magic experience for every successful cast (not including some last hits). rsrc184 is useful during long trips. High-level players can easily kill Salarin (and the nearby rsrc3710) multiple times with little or no need for food. If also killing the chaos druids, bringing an rsrc15979-firing rsrc16432 will kill them quickly. There is a point in the corridor where the player can attack Salarin, and he will try to retreat rather than attack. This is useful for low-level players who are not confident about taking on a high-level monster at close quarters.  Before the release of the rsrc352 skill, killing Salarin for the rsrc6776 was the only way to obtain rsrc1471. The area Salarin is found in contains rsrc1210 graves. The significance of this, if any, is unknown. He will sometimes say, \"Your pitiful attacks cannot hurt me!\" even when the player is using rsrc11171, which can hurt him. Prior to 14 August 2014, Salarin the twisted could be damaged by the rsrc1354. This has been fixed."

    "article-text": "\u200bSand Crabs are rsrc16139 monsters that look like harmless sandy rocks while disguised, but attack when walked by in an identical fashion to the older rsrc4187. They are found along the southern coast in rsrc1584's rsrc2022. No favour is required to access or kill them, they are available to all players who are willing to traverse the distance to get to them. There is a bank chest nearby as well, so players running the distance should bring rsrc18067. The rsrc984 cannot be used against Sand Crabs. Sand Crabs effectively serve as a replacement to Rock Crabs and enable rsrc18068 training due to their clusters in some spots, with little attention needed to train on them. Sand Crabs have 10 more rsrc65 than Rock Crabs and are otherwise identical in stats and behaviour, with clusters of multiple Sand Crabs next to each other in some spots, numbering 4 or more surrounding several spots on rsrc7420. Players wishing to train on Crabclaw Isle must bring 10,000 coins and may also find these spots to be occupied. Sand Crabs will become rsrc16323 if the player has not left the surrounding area in 10 minutes. To make the crabs aggressive again, exit the surrounding area - roughly the same distance as the diameter of the minimap - and enter again. As they are \"dormant\" (and cannot be seen on the rsrc8743) until \"awoken\" by a passing player, Sand Crabs cannot be attacked until they are made aggressive once more. rsrc4091 have likewise mostly replaced Sand Crabs. Ammonite Crabs have 100 Hitpoints and level 1 in all other stats, like the other crabs, but have slightly different mechanics; they are spaced far apart, but also have a far aggression range. The only downsides are that they tend to be somewhat crowded by higher-levelled players, and there are few spots to kill them. Because of their near-nonexistent offensive and defensive stats, they could be used to train from level 3 to 126, but seeing very low levels is extremely uncommon, and higher levels tend to move on to train at the rsrc238, rsrc4110, or Ammonite Crabs. There is an altar somewhat nearby the Sand Crabs, so it may be advisable to recharge rsrc81 at this altar whenever resetting their aggression. Players planning to do so would do well to bring equipment with good Prayer bonuses. Additionally, for non-rsrc16104 players, 55 Prayer is very helpful with rsrc5411 unlocked as it allows your potions to last longer. The new larger sand crab counterpart, rsrc897, were released with the new Catacombs batch of updates under Great Kourend. King Sand Crabs only share similarities in name, appearance, and in being dormant until walked near; they are powerful in offensive and defensive stats. A new location called rsrc9034 was recently released alongside the quest rsrc7007. There are several spots in here with 2-3 Sand Crabs next to each other, as well as a smaller cave with some King Sand Crabs. The cave is on the south-southeastern coast of Kourend, south of the Woodcutting Guild. Alongside the caves, another location to kill Sand Crabs is immediately east of the quest starting point. It does not have any spots with 3 or more Sand Crabs next to each other. Sand Crabs are in a remote area and there is no fast way to access them. If you have not been to rsrc1584 before, you will only be able to use method #1, unless you have access to Fairy Rings. It is advised to bring weight-reducing gear and dump any heavy items that bring your weight above 0.0kg (lower actually doesn't make a difference in your rsrc1874), as there is a bank chest in the center of the beach. There are several ways to get to them. If you haven't been there before, use the world map as you go along to avoid getting lost: In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the rsrc16088."

    "article-text": "Saradomin wizards appear when doing rsrc655 coordinates outside of the rsrc464. They call out \"For rsrc1222!\" upon appearing. They attack with a poisoned rsrc278, and cast rsrc877 when maging. Players should take caution when fighting Saradomin wizards as they will change attack styles if protection rsrc81 are used. Similar to rsrc6524, they will almost always rsrc296 the player when fought if rsrc1264 is not activated. Saradomin wizards have a somewhat low rsrc30, so rsrc507 or rsrc78 is advised. Magic is not advised as they are resistant due to their high Magic level. For players using Ranged or a rsrc498, they may be able to make use of nearby obstacles to attack the Saradomin wizard over, as the wizard will exclusively use Magic and the player can activate rsrc5495 to negate all damage. Another method for Ranged users is to run away and cause the player to leave the Saradomin wizard's patrol zone, causing the wizard to wander around aimlessly; the player can then safely dispatch the wizard from afar. Melee users should either wear armour resistant to melee and activate Protect from Magic OR wear armour resistant to Magic and activate Protect from Melee. Players who have a low Magic level should use the former method as a player's Magic level heavily influences their resistance to Magic attacks. If Protect from Melee is not being used, a form of rsrc1037 is necessary as the player is almost always guaranteed to become poisoned.  Interestingly, the Saradomin wizard can cast Saradomin Strike while wielding a dragon dagger, even though players can only cast the spell while wielding a rsrc9221. This trait is also shared by rsrc13263. Surprisingly, there is a rare effect that enables the wizard to sometimes inflict poison when using Saradomin Strike, even if he does not use melee at all throughout the fight. This is actually caused by the mechanic that the wizard uses to poison the player. If the wizard is in melee range and the player is not using rsrc1264, the wizard has about a 95% chance of causing poison for each game tick that passes. The first game tick could fail, for example, but the poison might be inflicted on the second or third tick. Activating Protect from Melee prevents this from happening by causing the wizard to use Magic instead. It's possible to imitate a Saradomin wizard by wearing rsrc2710 and rsrc2707, rsrc10415, rsrc278 and rsrc2517 while having the default avatar head characteristics. If the player manages to hide from a Saradomin wizard and digs again in the correct coordinate spot, another wizard will appear."

Although their max hit is low, they are highly accurate with an extremely fast rsrc73 and are very likely to poison any players that they attack. They can crawl up from the ground randomly in some pyramid areas, and have a chance of spawning when the gold chest is opened in rsrc2109. They are only rsrc10611 to players that cause them to spawn. Once the targeted player leaves, the scarab swarm will ignore other players and eventually despawn. The scarab swarms that spawn in rsrc10708 are simply known as rsrc10711.

They are identical in appearance and behaviour to scarab swarms, including their extremely fast attack speed and ability to poison, making them dangerous for lower levelled players. They randomly spawn inside the rsrc10708 by emerging from cracks in the ground. When they appear, the player they are targeting will stop moving momentarily, leaving them vulnerable to attacks from rsrc1340 if they do not have rsrc1264 activated. Unlike scarab swarms, they are constantly aggressive to all players.

After the rsrc12247's demise, the Sea Troll Queen emerges from the water to launch a surprise attack. She is able to inflict a single hit of 254 damage on the rsrc3109, leaving him incapacitated. The player must then defend the colony from her by themselves. Like many other boss monsters, a rsrc984 will not work on her; she will immediately destroy it. Warning: This fight occurs in an instanced area. This means you cannot recover any unprotected items should you die. Important: It is critical to defeat the Sea Troll Queen as fast as possible if using Prayer. Her draining attack drains over 20 rsrc16116 at once. In any case, bringing rsrc1044 is advised. The Sea Troll Queen attacks using rsrc507 (rsrc15934) and, more often, a magic projectile resembling rsrc842, with the latter being her more powerful attack. The Sea Troll Queen cannot move during the fight, and instead reverts to her prayer-draining ability should the player remain outside of melee distance with an overhead prayer active. Generally, the best way to deal with the Sea Troll Queen is to use rsrc5495 and tank the melee attacks in order to prevent the occurrence of prayer drains. Conversely, fighting her at range should only be attempted by players who are prepared to use many prayer potions or withstand powerful magic attacks. The Sea Troll Queen's most prominent weaknesses are rsrc15937 and rsrc78 attacks. She is most resistant to magic attacks due to having a very high magic level. Therefore, it is advantageous to plan your equipment accordingly before starting this section of the quest. It is also helpful to bring a secondary weapon for its rsrc15915 such as a rsrc5001.  Although she is the queen of rsrc2488, the Sea Troll Queen does not look like a troll at all; she oddly resembles a rsrc1483. Although this monster inflicts 254 damage on the Wise Old Man (which is more than enough to outright kill a player of any level), the latter's health bar appears to be unaffected. Unlike most defeated quest bosses, the Sea Troll Queen cannot be encountered in the rsrc238, possibly due to the inhospitable environment there."

The Possible rewards were included were: The guard could also be attacked and killed, but this is not recommended, despite his max hit of 2, he had high rsrc30 and a total of 250 rsrc65, and the damage done to him only gives you a quarter of an rsrc19 point per damage done. Also, he is immune to rsrc296. If you take too long to kill him, he will eventually disappear. If a player decides to fight him, he is weak to rsrc10665 attacks and rsrc59. rsrc78 will have an easy time against him, too. This is not recommended, as you will only gain a quarter of an experience point each hit while fighting a Security Guard. Additionally, despite advertising the Stronghold of Security, he still comes when you actually are in the Stronghold. If you teleport away, he will say 'He/She got away!' before disappearing. If the player already possess a security book in his rsrc424, the NPC would not provide another one. "

The shades in the Stronghold of Security are found next to the ladder leading to the current floor alongside a rsrc14605, while the ones in the Catacombs of Kourend are found in the northernmost area of Reeking Cove, south from the rsrc562. It is worth noting that combat experience gained while fighting the shades in the Stronghold of Security is drastically reduced; the player will gain 1 experience for 10 damage dealt. As shades are rsrc277, they are affected by the rsrc1086 and rsrc825. They are also extremely weak to the rsrc6341, although a rsrc639 deals more damage on average. They are generally regarded as a terrible way to complete the \"Shades\" rsrc16024 due to their high damage and high hitpoints (the better choice being rsrc18079 in rsrc1619), with the only notable drops being shade robe pieces, which have little practicality. Shades in the Stronghold of Security can be rsrc16428 using a skeleton found on the eastern side in the middle northern part of the room. They also have reduced xp rates amounting to 4xp per slayer kill Before the rsrc15919 update in rsrc75, the shade used to appear randomly when burying rsrc2071. On appearance, it would say \"Leave this place!\". As with similar guardian random events, the shade's rsrc173 and stats scaled with the player's combat level, as well as only being attackable by the targeted player. The shade was somewhat rare, as rsrc15921 players rarely buried bones in high enough quantities to activate this random event. Also, rsrc81 had two other random events that could occur while training it: rsrc14605 and rsrc16333. Shades would not appear if training Prayer via the rsrc1937 or a rsrc1941."

They can be irritating for players who are trying to put a gem or mirror into a pillar; as such running behind the pillar so they cannot attack the player is recommended as they respawn fast when slain.

Unlike other pests, shifters are immune to the effects of poison. For some reason shifters are some of the few monsters that can attack at a diagonal.

Sigmund is a high-ranking member of rsrc16211, a former advisor to rsrc1460 and the main antagonist in the rsrc17517. He has been involved in three attempts to destroy the rsrc2165 rsrc873. The first was during the rsrc17518 rsrc15898, the second during the rsrc3232 quest, and again in the rsrc1269 quest. During this quest, the player is sent to recover silverware allegedly stolen by underground goblins. During this quest, it is discovered that Sigmund has taken the silverware and is a member of Humans Against Monsters, or rsrc16211. His attempts at creating a war between rsrc538 and the rsrc2165 were thwarted, and he was dismissed for treason by rsrc1460. During the rsrc3232 quest, it is revealed by a rsrc16211 member that Sigmund and rsrc12224, head of H.A.M, are 'planning something big'. After eavesdropping on the H.A.M council, it is discovered that they are using a machine they bought from the dwarves of rsrc672 for unknown purposes. Once the dead Dorgeshuun rsrc4945 has been revived, she reveals that the H.A.M are going to use the machine to flood the rsrc2165 capital, rsrc1271. After infiltrating the caves with the machine in it and slaying the H.A.M helpers, the player and Zanik battle the level 50 Sigmund. Using a rsrc4896, he escapes death and swears that they will meet again. The ring works even if you reduce his rsrc65 to 0. Sigmund is rather simple to defeat. First, players must defeat his cronies. Afterwards, both the player and rsrc4945 can focus on Sigmund alone. Sigmund, probably out of spite of Zanik, will use rsrc3014 rather than the rsrc16953 against whatever rsrc10737 you use, thus making him vulnerable. In this quest, Sigmund and his men ambush rsrc873 at the rsrc2369. After a brief struggle, he captures rsrc4945 and ties her to the new rail line linking rsrc672 and rsrc1271 in the hopes of starting war between the two cities. However, his plans are foiled by an adventurer who defeats him and manages to get Zanik off the track just before the train arrives. This time, Sigmund is slightly harder to defeat. rsrc4945 will not be able to help you, and his combat level has increased from level 50 to level 64 since the last encounter. He will activate protection prayers depending on which combat style the player attacks with. "

This is due to a famous legend stating that Sir Leye had been blessed by rsrc1222 himself, and that no \"man\" can defeat him. If your rsrc10513 is male, you can damage him as much as you want, but even if his rsrc65 reach zero, they will automatically reset to its maximum, making him invincible. However, if you try to kill him as a female character, his health won't reset back, effectively killing him. Out of the seven possible tests given to the player in the Training Grounds, it is guaranteed they will have to fight Sir Leye.  Sir Leye's name is a play on the word \"Surly\". His invincibility against any man may be a reference to the prophecy of Glorfindel, featured in Tolkien's novel rsrc16722, for the rsrc18083 fell not by \"the hand of man\". The prophecy fulfilled as he is killed by rsrc18084, princess of rsrc18085."

    "article-text": "Skeletal Wyverns are rsrc6905 that require a Slayer level of 72 in order to be harmed. They are found at the end of the rsrc3170. Like other Wyverns, they require an rsrc1387, rsrc1388, rsrc1394, rsrc1455, or rsrc1383 to reduce damage from their icy breath however it is not required to be slain. They are also the only monster that drops rsrc6631. Although it is insinuated in rsrc9175 that Skeletal Wyverns are rsrc277, they are in fact re-animated remains, whereas actual rsrc277 creatures have come back to life. This causes the rsrc1086 and its enchanted versions to not work against them. Skeletal Wyverns are assigned by rsrc6317, and after the rsrc18087 update on 10 September 2015, also by rsrc5775 and rsrc7309. Unlike other Wyverns, Skeletal Wyverns do not drop the rsrc1386; instead they drop the rsrc1398. Skeletal Wyverns have high rsrc30, rsrc28, and rsrc65, thus making them very challenging opponents. They attack with rsrc507, rsrc78, or their unique ice-breath attack. This attack can freeze players similar to the rsrc120' rsrc10497, with the addition of preventing the player from retaliating back for the duration of the freeze. However, players may still eat and drink potions while frozen. Players should wield a(n) rsrc1383, rsrc1388, rsrc1387 or rsrc1394/rsrc1455, which negates stat loss as well as lowering the max hit of ice breath attacks to 10. As such, if the player does not have or cannot afford a dragonfire shield, rsrc214 is essentially a hidden requirement for killing Wyverns. If a player is not wearing one of the shields, they will be hit for very high damage. Contrary to popular belief, rsrc4920 does not affect the accuracy of the ice-breath attack; the ice-breath will hit through all types of armour. rsrc3014 is the suggested rsrc81 to use on this fight due to the amount of range damage Skeletal Wyverns do, followed by rsrc1264, although it is not needed if you safe spot them. Due to their moderate Defence and defence bonuses, Melee is recommended to kill Wyverns, unless your Defence level is low. If killing Wyverns with Melee, an rsrc252 is recommended due to its high rsrc15936 bonuses. Wyverns are slightly weak to rsrc59; for those using it, rsrc10055 is recommended. You can rsrc16428 Wyverns in multiple ways. A common method for doing this is getting them stuck behind the main entrance. Players should always wait for the Wyverns to get rsrc16323 before attempting this; otherwise, they'll get hit by other Wyverns when trying to safespot another. A good method to make them unaggressive is wait in front of the main entrance for ten to twenty minutes. This will make the Wyverns unaggressive near the entrance. Players can only walk around two steps inside the cave, if they go deeper, the Wyverns will get rsrc16139 again. Alternatively, for safe-spotting, players can bring a few rsrc1044 and attack the Wyvern from seven steps away with rsrc18088 on.  The sound effects of their Ranged and breath attacks are similar to rsrc10517. Prior to the rsrc18089 on 18 September 2014, the drops of the Skeletal Wyvern were much poorer \u2014 their only unique items being rsrc6631 and the rsrc1398. Most of their drops were replaced with more valuable drops, such as 10 rsrc815, 35 rsrc1756, and rsrc9112 drops. As of rsrc17020 on 21 January 2016, there is now an extended area exclusively for players who have a task of Skeletal Wyverns which can be accessed by climbing up the stairs near the passageway to the Wyverns, which was added due to player complaints on overcrowding due to the popularity of the Wyverns as a method of making money."

Being an undead monster, it is weak to rsrc825 and the rsrc1086. It is also weak against rsrc15934 attacks. While doing rsrc6385 quest, a level 13 skeleton will appear when the player picks up the ghost's rsrc2169. Players can purchase level 22 skeleton guards for their rsrc18090 in their rsrc156. However, they do not contribute towards a rsrc3482. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550.  The level 45 skeletons in the rsrc10680, just outside of rsrc4775's lair, seem taller than the other skeletons and appear to be the same size as rsrc11949. Upon release, the skeletons in the rsrc797 crypts did not drop the rsrc9516. This was changed a few years later. Upon opening a wardrobe, there is a 1/21 chance of a non-interactable skeleton appearing inside.rsrc9854 This is a reference to rsrc18091. If there is a skeleton inside the wardrobe, searching the wardrobe yields the text \"Eek! There's a skeleton in there.\" There are level 35 skeletons in the rsrc10386 - they cannot be attacked, and examining them gives the text \"Even in death he still fights.\" While they have swords, they use the same attack animation as rsrc3711."

Players are advised to use rsrc1264 against these monsters, as they attack accurately and can easily overwhelm with their sheer numbers. They are aggressive to all players who are not using a rsrc3318 to turn themselves into a monkey. Their tendency to cluster around a player means that they are often a popular choice for players powertraining rsrc78 or rsrc59. Players who have access to rsrc376 should kill them instead as these skeletons do not have any drops to mitigate supply costs. It is worth noting that these skeletons have the tendency of spawning from the bones they drop. To prevent an overflow of extra skeletons, they will disappear into a pile of burning bones after a short while. When they respawn, they do so with an animation of them coming out of the ground, this is unique among other monsters. The bones cannot be taken away from rsrc1256, and when rsrc16098 out a message appears saying 'The skeleton bones you are carrying crumble to dust'. Ashes are then left in your inventory. Ranged As stated previously, skeleton monkeys provide excellent Ranged experience rates when attacked with chinchompas of any kind. High ranged bonus is advisable to reduce the amount of failed attacks. It should be advised that upon rsrc2672, ALL chinchompas will be lost, and they will not retrievable upon death. Low levels or people who suffer from lag should consider bringing far fewer chinchompas. Magic Using rsrc120 to kill skeleton monkeys is considered one of the best rsrc10535 methods. Due to the high cost of rsrc884 it is recommended to bring good equipment to minimise the amount of splashing. Note that in some cases prayer bonus should be prioritised over magic bonus. *This cannot be used to rsrc808 Ancients, and its rsrc1364 variant reduces experience rates with its rsrc1342 damage. Use it at your own discretion. Inventory:"

They both make use of rsrc59 to attack. Thus, it is recommended to wear magic-resistant armour such as rsrc3050. They play a role in the rsrc913 rsrc15898, where the player creates an army of them to help defeat the rsrc2488. Level 16 mages usually attack with melee and will occasionally cast a spell, exclaiming \"I infect your body with rot...\" that resembles rsrc3185 as a projectile and rsrc3184 when it lands successfully. If successful, it will lower the player's rsrc28, rsrc64 and rsrc30 stats by 4 levels. Level 83 mages cast fire spells, and will sometimes use the rsrc8125 spell on a player. rsrc3270 will occasionally spawn a non-attackable skeleton mage, which follows him around for a while before disappearing. After completing the rsrc913 quest, these skeleton mages can be spawned by the player using rsrc915. Players can give an rsrc911 to Malignius Mortifer to receive more bone seeds. When they open the pot they receive, a skeleton mage appears, performs a random emote, and falls apart. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550. "

Many players find warlords nuisances whilst killing other monsters such as rsrc18095. This is due to the fact that they are aggressive and will attack players while they are fighting other monsters. When fighting waterfiends with a Saradomin Godsword, it is helpful to use its special attack on the warlords to heal, since waterfiends have a high resistance to its slash-form attack. Note: They can hit up to 15, so it is recommended to avoid combat with them, as there are easier to kill monsters that drop similar loot.

Accessing its lair requires the use of a rsrc4516 on the altar found in the centre of the Catacombs; one dark totem permits only one attempt. According to rsrc7806, Skotizo was a former general of rsrc1220 during the God Wars, and led an expedition to recover an artefact, under Zamorak's direct orders, in the rsrc5492 found deep within the rsrc2948. However, he soon betrayed Zamorak and his squad, taking the power for himself and decimating the expedition team. What happened to him next is unknown, though it is known he eventually made his way to the rsrc1323, where he resides to this day. Skotizo will always drop one shard, with a rare chance to drop an additional 1-4.  Skotizo is a transliteration of an Ancient Greek verb meaning \"to darken\". Skotizo is the only rsrc597 that has the rsrc5528 as part of its normal drop table; all other monsters indirectly drop it via the rsrc550. Prior to an rsrc16516 on 28 July 2016, Skotizo's rsrc92 drop rate was 1/50."

It hits somewhat hard, and has very high defence, but it does not hit very often. rsrc1264 is recommended as it can hit up to 13 damage, although it is very inaccurate. Like rsrc2052, pickaxes work well against it. High-level players should have no problem dispatching this monster, assuming they bring a good weapon and armour. It drops rsrc689, an rsrc1952, and an rsrc1951 when defeated, whose total value is 6,693. Slagilith cannot be fought again once it has been defeated once during rsrc917, so this monster cannot be used to repeatedly obtain its drops which sell for a good amount of money when combined. It can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete, however, it will drop nothing.  The word Slagilith was censored in chat, because \"slag\" is a derogatory term for a woman who sleeps around."

    "article-text": "Slash Bash is a rsrc431 encountered during the rsrc315 quest. He uses both rsrc507 and rsrc78 attacks. It is vital to have rsrc323 or rsrc6766, and at least rsrc1204 or better when fighting him, as the rsrc7108 can drain stats by up to 15. He is very difficult as he can drain your rsrc81 and switch between devastating range and powerful melee. However, it is possible to use rsrc59 or range from behind the stand or a stack of bones, and then he can only damage the player using range. As with all Zogres, rsrc18098 and the rsrc825 spell are his weakness. Other attacks, such as melee, will be futile, as they can only hit up to 25% of the normal max hit (for example, up to 5 if a player normally hits up to 20) on Slash Bash. Taking too long to kill Slash Bash will cause him to disappear, forcing a player to fight him again. It is possible to safe spot him using brutal arrows or Crumble Undead spell. Using rsrc3014 prayer with this method will reduce the damage taken to 0. People mostly prefer using rsrc18099 due to their considerable rsrc469. He plays a short but important role in the quest rsrc315. When the Ogres find out that the rsrc431 curse is irreversible, they decide to make their sacred burial ground in another spot, but for it to be sacred, the hero must retrieve the ancient sacred artefact that was left behind in the rsrc2817. When the hero tries to take the artefact Slash Bash enters and attacks him/her, only to be slain by the hero. Slash Bash inhabits the deepest part of the Zogre Caves, the ancient chamber, a locked room where the ancient sacred artefact is kept. The room is beyond the two stone doors, and down a set of stairs; it contains some intimidating monsters.  Slash Bash appears to be wearing the artifact you are sent to retrieve on his head, which explains why he drops it when he dies. Slash Bash might be a reference to the rsrc18100 game \"Crash Bash\"."

The people of rsrc887 are obviously very mad at you for killing the Slug Prince, as after you kill him they tell you to leave them alone. The Slug Prince can only be fought with rsrc507; using rsrc78 or rsrc59 is futile, as they bounce harmlessly off. However, he is very easy, and high and medium level players can kill him without prayer or food. If you do choose to use rsrc1264, be aware that the Slug Prince's attacks may drain rsrc81. A high or medium levelled player should have little to no problems fighting him, but lower levels might want to bring rsrc184 or even rsrc1044. A rsrc1129 and a rsrc2451 do not work against the Slug Prince. The Slug Prince's appearance is a small, shell-like body, with one mouthlike object protruding from the front. Its appearance is similar to that of a hermit crab. The Prince is no bigger than the player's character, which might mean the prince is a larva of some sort, and that there are other slugs that are rsrc8472's size.  Although the Slug Prince doesn't drop anything, he leaves behind \"Slug goo\", with the examine text \"Exploding goo.\" and remains so even through rsrc8472's rsrc137."

    "article-text": "The smoke devil is a mutated version of a rsrc685, found at the rsrc9538. These require a minimum of 93 rsrc285 and an active Slayer task to be harmed. A rsrc282, rsrc286, or a rsrc6022 is required to kill these. This monster, along with its rsrc1359 and rsrc5438, are the only monsters to drop the rsrc57. Smoke devils reside in a rsrc17944, so players can rsrc18101/rsrc18102 or use rsrc18103 on them, though only the former is particularly effective. Given the fact that the smoke devil chamber is very large, bringing a rsrc984 is recommended to get their attention. The various remains that litter the chamber act as \"walls\", so smoke devils can be stacked on top of one another for bursting/barraging quickly by hiding behind a pile of remains. When fighting them, using protect from range will negate their attacks. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the standard rsrc550.  In RuneScape 3, rsrc18104 are familiars that require a Summoning level of 61 to use."

He is capable of using a highly lethal form of rsrc2988, although when the player fights him he attacks exclusively with much weaker rsrc507. Prior to beginning the rsrc1774 quest, Solus was already widely known as the \"murder mage\", due to the fact that he was a mass murderer. He had managed to elude the authorities for so long due to his incredible rsrc59 abilities, as he had enough skill to be able to slow down the process of teleportation enough that he was literally in three places at once- the point from which he teleported, the rsrc257 and also the destination of his teleport spell. He was also capable of greatly increasing the damage that could be done by the rsrc837 spell, allowing him to cripple even the strongest player. Fortunately, Solus was captured at some point by the rsrc12061 and was kept their prisoner until recently. When the player originally rsrc128, rsrc1778 had failed to go through the proper method of recruitment, and so in order for the player to progress up the ranks of Temple Knight, they were required to join the rsrc10285. In order to do this a crisis was needed, and so it was arranged for the release of Solus Dellagar in the hope that the player, along with the Temple Knights, would be able to recapture him. By using secret Temple Knight technology, the player was able to track Solus to the rsrc16332 headquarters and then the rsrc1220 shrine in rsrc378. Eventually the player managed to trap him at the rune esssence mine. A squad of Temple Knight archers arrived to take Solus into custody, but he was able to defeat them all in a single blow, leaving just the player to fight. Solus was eventually slain, leaving only his hat as proof of his death, and allowing the player to fully join the ranks of the Temple Knights "

Upon striking a player, these projectiles will ricochet towards other players as small grey projectiles, which can be blocked with rsrc3014. Failing to protect against Sotetseg's attacks will block the player's prayer for 5 seconds. Sotetseg will also occasionally fire a large red projectile at a single player. All players must stand within a 3 \u00d7 3 area of the targeted player to disperse the damage; failing to do so will result in targeted player taking up to 115 damage. Correct prayer protection must also be applied. At 66.6% and 33.3% hitpoints, Sotetseg will choose a single player and transport them into the shadow realm. The player must follow the red path on the tiled ground and click on the portal to return to the arena. The transported player will also constantly take hits of 3 damage while in the realm. The players in the arena must also follow the same path, however, they will only be able to see the current location of the transported player, denoted by a red glow on the tiled ground. Concurrently, players in the arena will also be chased by a red vortex that will deal damage to the whole party if intercepted.  \"S\u00f6t\u00e9ts\u00e9g\" means \"Darkness\" in Hungarian."

The Soulless were originally brave adventurers (possibly rsrc4767 found in rsrc23) that had attempted to purify the rsrc17234 from the quest rsrc495. However, the voice of rsrc1108 drove them insane. rsrc5111 fell for this \"voice\" during rsrc17002. Apparently, the victims of Iban are all locked into cages, being subjected to Iban's voice until they deteriorate to become the rsrc18107. They are seen as still visibly human, rocking back and forth with extremely pale skin. From here, they deteriorate further into \"Soulless\", though we don't actually see this process. Soulless are aggressive to low/medium levelled players and rsrc13553 when they have low health. They drop nothing beside bones. They are found in the Underground Pass. They dwell at the bottom of the chasm, below the cages where the rsrc7038 are kept and found around rsrc13552. Soulless can be used for training as they have high Hitpoints and very low accuracy, low defence as well as low strength. It is quite easy to dispatch one in one blow. The fact that they will often retreat makes them perfect for players using a multicannon as the cannon will shoot at all soulless in the area without you being attacked by other soulless and having combat interrupted causing the cannon to target the enemy attacking you. The downside of this method is the fact that they reside in a remote location and they drop nothing but bones.  In-game, they used to be referred to as \"Souless\", which was a typo. This was changed in rsrc16185 on 13 July rsrc125, and their name now properly reads \"Soulless\"."

Spiritual mages will use Magic against players, but will use a weak Ranged attack with a max hit of 1 when fighting other monsters. As a result, they often remain in combat until killed.

There are four types of Spiritual warriors: rsrc1222, rsrc1220, rsrc1273, and rsrc1664. Spiritual warriors require 68 rsrc285 to kill (note Spiritual creatures cannot be given as a rsrc3482 if the player has not completed the rsrc440 quest). Just like rsrc471 and rsrc18113, there are Spiritual warriors from each god. Spiritual warriors frequently drop rsrc7966, rsrc434 and rsrc4588, so it is advisable to bring runes for rsrc8. For players killing Spiritual warriors as part of a rsrc3482 wanting to avoid being attacked by them, the main area contains Saradominist warriors who are often engaged in combat with other monsters. A good place to kill Spiritual warriors is just outside of the Zamorak Boss chamber as there are plenty of them. 70 rsrc65 are required to access the rsrc1220 base, and the player's prayer points will be completely drained upon entering. There are rsrc18013 (piles of stones) inside the Zamorak base, which can be used to safely kill Spiritual warriors with rsrc78 or rsrc59. As with all other Armadylian monsters, the Armadyl variant can only be attacked with Ranged or Magic. They also use Ranged instead of melee to attack. The Armadylian variant is not considered an rsrc686 for the purposes of a rsrc3482, even though when the player attempts to attack one with melee a message in the player's chatbox appears saying \"The Aviansie is flying too high for you to attack using melee.\" In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550.   On release, Spiritual warriors dropped medium clue scrolls, but were updated to drop hard instead. The Armadylian Spiritual warriors also hit very low and had inaccurate attacks, this was later fixed. Zamorakian warriors appear to have a Gnome/Glarial's amulet (similar to the crystal pendant which the player receives in the quest rsrc495). Their weapons resemble an rsrc1402 from the rsrc1400 rsrc132. Also, the armour they are wearing looks like a red version of rsrc5313 and rsrc5314. Even though the Zamorakian warriors wield a mace, they punch when attacking. Zamorakian warriors seem to have a graphical glitch where their hands do not seem to be gripping the handle of their weapons correctly, as their hands seem to be too far down the handle. Zamorakian spiritual warriors appear to have another glitch. They seem to be holding their maces through their bodies. Spiritual creatures are blocked by 113,241 players and were the most blocked slayer monster in 2017. Since release both Saradomin and Zamorakian spiritual warriors attacked their enemies by punching at them despite carrying a weapon. This was fixed with an rsrc16190 on 19 July 2018."

Like other rsrc15905, they require an rsrc1387, rsrc1388, rsrc1394 or rsrc1383 to be equipped in order to be slain. Unlike their rsrc410 variant, Spitting Wyverns can use their icy breath from any distance. They will use rsrc78 when attacking from a distance, and will not try to use rsrc507 unless the target is in melee range. Their Ranged attack is weak; however, it may hit the player multiple times if it is a rsrc813. If on a rsrc16024, it is highly recommended that you kill this variant of Fossil Island wyvern because of its slow ranged attack speed and relatively low hits when it successfully lands this attack. Compared to the rsrc1393, the next variant of wyvern, both Slayer and rsrc712 experience are the same, and the Spitting Wyvern has arguably a better drop table, yielding more rsrc1646 and rsrc18116 drops compared to the Long-Tailed Wyvern. Coupled with the slow kill rate of Long-Tailed Wyverns, Spitting Wyverns are a better choice for killing in nearly all metrics.   They appear to use all attack styles when using rsrc507, depending on the animation they use: rsrc17687 when they use their talons, rsrc17688 when they jab with their tail and rsrc17689 when they bite the target. Upon release, the wyvern's rsrc30 level was 120. This was reduced to 90 in rsrc17691 on 18 January rsrc231. This also changed its rsrc173 from 146 to 139. Upon release, Spitting Wyverns only dropped a maximum of 6 seaweed spores. This was increased to 12 in rsrc16554 on 12 July rsrc231."

Splatters will never attack the rsrc16075, and if killed near it, no damage would be dealt to the Void Knight. Splatter detonations can be used strategically akin to a rsrc18117 by causing them to detonate near large groups of monsters. This does work on portals. Protection prayers do not prevent the damage.

Steel dragons are the fourth strongest of the six kinds of rsrc5516, behind rsrc1285, rsrc607 and rsrc4296. They have a chance of dropping the rsrc1398, which is the motivation of many steel dragon killers. Like their fellow metallic brethren, steel dragons can use long-range dragonfire in addition to using melee. The steel dragon boasts a higher max hit and accuracy compared to the rsrc365, although it is far weaker than a mithril dragon. When given a task of steel dragons for rsrc285, they can be an extremely hard and long task for unprepared players. The cheapest way for players to kill them are using bolt spells with rsrc18118 to increase damage. Players can also use a rsrc9544 and rsrc1366. Alternatively, players can use ranged with an imbued slayer helmet to cover up lost accuracy against the dragon's high ranged defence. Higher levelled players can use the rsrc275 or rsrc1354/rsrc1361 to kill steel dragons. They drop rsrc18119 frequently and have an increased chance of dropping rsrc2148 and rsrc5409 over their weaker metal counterparts (being the rsrc365 and rsrc458). However, the rsrc9059, rsrc391 and rsrc9014 generate quite a nice sum of rsrc16063 when rsrc8 to conserve inventory space. Players can pick up the rsrc18120 they drop to make profit, as they drop 5 at a time. However, this is unviable because players will need to bank after 4-5 kills which can hamper kill rates. Even with the completion of the rsrc17199, which notes their steel bars, it is somewhat impractical as they are surrounded by many iron dragons. If they are fought without complete dragonfire protection, it is recommended to stay in melee range and use rsrc1264, to reduce the amount of dragonfire damage taken. These items are dropped alongside the other items listed above. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has a 1/32 chance to access the rsrc16088.  "

He is non-attackable to the players not doing the quest rsrc1336, and attempting to attack the stranger when not doing Desert Treasure will yield the message, \"He has no interest in fighting you.\" Most notably the stranger is capable of using the dragon dagger rsrc1267 MUCH MORE FREQUENTLY AND ENDLESSLY than a player can, and can even land two special attacks in successive ticks - players unable to use rsrc1264 or have low-level armour should avoid him at all costs. He does not seem to be limited to a special attack bar like a player is, and his attack speed varies throughout the fight. The moment at which the stranger appears is random, as long as the player is carrying one or more of the diamonds. He can appear right after a diamond is obtained, which can be annoying since the player may be depleted of supplies. The more diamonds the player has, the greater the chance for him to appear. When he appears, he says \"You are not worthy holding that Diamond of Blood/Ice/Shadow/Smoke!\" If the player kills him, a chat window will pop up with them asking themselves \"I wonder what that was all about?\" "

    "article-text": "Suqah are a race of strange-looking but powerful creatures native to rsrc207. Players must have at least started rsrc205 to have access to Lunar Isle. Despite their fearsome nature, they have a peaceful relationship with the rsrc5791, but are aggressive to outsiders, effectively serving as guards. Suqah are viewed as an extremely good rsrc16024, due to the high amount of rsrc19 per hour that can be gained from killing them. Using a rsrc984, Suqah provide some of the fastest rsrc285 experience per hour in the entire game. Be sure to bring some rsrc184 to these monsters as they hit very high and often if not wearing rsrc507 armour. It is recommended to also have a high rsrc59 level, high magic rsrc18121, or use rsrc5495, as the Suqah may also attack with magic and deal massive amounts of damage while wearing melee armour such as rsrc4588, especially in the northern part of the isle where they attack with melee and a weak version of rsrc2988 or rsrc842 on their opponents. Tip: With level 80 prayer use dragonbone necklace and bone crusher for infinite prayer. Five Suqah are located on the southern part of Lunar Isle, none of which attack with magic, therefore making it a good spot for players assigned Suqah as a slayer task that do not wish to use the rsrc5495 rsrc81. There is a rsrc16428 next to the tree closest to the rsrc5574, and standing on the bridge will also work. A rsrc1826 is required  to use the bank located on the Lunar Isle if the player has not completed the rsrc1829 rsrc15898. This quest allows you to bank at the rsrc6277 called rsrc9282 in the Lunar Isle bank. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has access to the rsrc16088.  Despite their high combat level, Suqah only drop the two lowest-level rsrc1646: rsrc18122 and rsrc1494. The rsrc6791 is one of the items used to pay a nearby gardener to protect a player's growing rsrc1091, along with a rsrc6794 and five rsrc6792."

The tentacles can hit anywhere on the boat, but will usually only attack the player's follower when the follower is directly in front of one of the swamp creature parts. Poisoning one part poisons all parts. If the head is near death and a tentacle is still alive, it will return to full health. The Head can hit very hard, but doesn't often and is also very slow. It is recommended to kill the part attacking your follower first, but not get too close to the head.  The swamp creature resembles the monster in the POH rsrc11587. When a tentacle spawns it displays a combat level of 136 instead of 99. After it spawns its combat will change to level 99."

Fighting within Melee range is advised as they will be made less likely to use this.   They appear to use all attack styles when using rsrc507, depending on the animation they use: rsrc17687 when they use their talons, rsrc17688 when they jab with their tail and rsrc17689 when they bite the target. Upon release, the wyvern's defence level was 120. This was reduced to 90 in rsrc17691 on 18 January rsrc231. This also changed its rsrc173 from 154 to 147. Upon release, Taloned Wyverns only dropped a maximum of 6 seaweed spores. This was increased to 12 in rsrc16554 on 12 July rsrc231."

Based on rsrc9999, Tekton was one of the few that was still loyal to rsrc5146 after the majority of rsrc1584 usurped him. He built many grand buildings to worship Xeric, though it is unknown if they are still around. He also believes he had a family and children, though it is unknown if any are still living to this day. He also oversaw the creation of the chambers under rsrc1375, in addition to creating a new temple. Xeric was pleased that Tekton gave him the ability to use cave magic, but was disappointed when everyone else began using it, especially the \"rsrc8273\". Xeric ordered him to destroy the temple, which he did, but only slightly in the event that Xeric changed his mind. Tekton tried to teach Xeric how to use the magic without the aid of the temple, but failed to. Xeric later took him into the caves and gave him immortality by putting his mind in a new, indestructible body, enchanting his anvil and teaching him now to repair his new body. While he gained a large amount of strength, Tekton eventually noted that he was unable to manipulate the crystals in the cave, but dismissed it as he believed that Xeric wanted his strength, not his intelligence. Tekton remains near his anvil, improving himself so that he can serve his master again when he returns. Tekton is seen working with his magnetic anvil. As soon as someone gets near him, he will notice them and begin the fight. All players should use rsrc1264 when fighting Tekton. Tekton is highly resistant and immune to rsrc78 and rsrc59 attacks (his journal states this), as a result, Tekton will have to be killed with rsrc507 only. The rsrc8125 spell can still be casted to lower his defence by 10%. He still has very high rsrc30, so using a rsrc16410rsrc274 or rsrc18123 is recommended against him. Tekton will emit two different auras beneath him: orange, which is his non-enraged stance, and red, which is his enraged stance. Tekton's overall rsrc30 is lower when he has a orange aura. The rsrc1267 of rsrc2134 or rsrc2126 are very useful to lower Tekton's high defence as well, as they both have unique effects against Tekton: Upon entering, players should all stand on the same space and lure him as far away from his anvil as possible. After being alerted to the team's presence, Tekton will move towards one player. He will stop when he reaches that player and starts attacking them. Players should then attack and run in a counter-clockwise motion around him, attacking at each turning corner. If Tekton attacks and no players are within melee range of him, he will return to the anvil. Otherwise, he will continue attacking for a prolonged duration before returning back to the anvil. When Tekton returns to the anvil, he heals himself slightly and sends out two \"sparks\" for each player in the room, dealing moderate damage in a 3x3 square. The flying sparks aim at where players are currently standing, so it is best to spread out and dodge the sparks by moving away from where you were standing. When he leaves the anvil, the targeted player should not move, or he will return to the anvil and heal again. After finishing this, Tekton gets a red aura around him, before reverting back to orange. Tekton will apply rapid stomp damage to players under him. However, this only applies when he moves, as he is static upon entering his attack stance. The pillars of smoke around his chamber can lightly damage players if they are on them. Tekton was considerably buffed a day after release to increase his \"massacring\" capabilities. Tekton is the only mid-raid boss that can drop a reward not exclusive to Chambers of Xeric upon death."

They are first encountered during the miniquest rsrc17566, in which the player must fight two terror dogs, alongside some animated armour in addition to rsrc18125 himself. Upon completion of the miniquest, more terror dogs will appear in the room the player battled Tarn Razorlor in. Terror dogs use an accurate melee attack. As the room they are fought in is a multi-combat area, fighting them can become very dangerous quickly, as multiple terror dogs can attack the player all at once. It should be noted that, without a rsrc3540, reaching the end of Tarn's lair is a time consuming and dangerous undertaking. Terror dogs do not count toward fulfilling a Slayer task for dogs; they are a separate task. They are the only monsters that drop the rsrc6630. Players can hide in Tarn's room just north of the terror dogs and wait for them to develop rsrc10710 to the player. This makes combating them significantly less risky. Be sure to log out to check for tolerance, as any dogs aggressive towards the player will remain so until the player exits Tarn's room, even if all other dogs are no longer aggressive. This will also cause all dogs targeting the player to stop and begin wandering around. Players can check to see if the dogs are still aggressive by exiting Tarn's room and waiting at the door for a quick retreat if they are. Terror dogs are similar to rsrc1326 in that they can hit hard and accurately, but have very low rsrc30. Unlike hellhounds, multiple terror dogs can attack at once. Players should be aware that the room that terror dogs are in at Tarn's Lair will drain rsrc81 at a rate of 1 point per two game ticks, or 50 points per minute (much faster than the rsrc797). Fighting terror dogs (mostly done for Slayer tasks) can be a difficult task for players who are unprepared. They can be safespotted if standing in the recesses after they have became tolerant of players. They can also be safespotted by luring one to the entrance of the tunnel to Tarn's room, and ranging it directly from the other side of the tunnel. Teleporting to Tarn's Lair via the slayer ring is the fastest way of reaching to the room with terror dogs. Otherwise, the player will have to get there by foot. The trek to terror dogs is highly dangerous, especially for lower level players. It is recommended to bring high healing foods, rsrc1044, and possibly dragonhide armour, if the player does not have access to rsrc5495, as the player will encounter rsrc2339 within the lair that casts strong magical attacks at the player. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550. "

It can only be found by using a rsrc7033 given by Sigli. This works very much like a rsrc866 talisman, telling the player in which direction to travel to find the Draugen. It will periodically move around, where it can be anywhere from the river leading to rsrc678 by the rsrc12351 spanning all the way east, and in the forest area east of Rellekka. Depending on where it is found, it may be lured behind a tree stump and rsrc16428. After a while it will teleport far from its last location, which gives the player the message in their chatbox \"The Draugen has moved elsewhere...\". A common strategy to find it quickly is by waiting in a specific location until it is nearby, usually by the river. rsrc1287 may also help. The Draugen is considered rsrc277 and thus is affected by the rsrc1086. It is  resistant to rsrc78 attacks.  The Draugen is based on rsrc18126, an undead creature from Norse mythology."

After you killed rsrc5575 (first form), it transforms into this monster, The Everlasting (second form). After this monster is killed, it transforms into a level 274 rsrc5569 (third form). And lastly when this one is killed, it transforms into a level 108 rsrc5572 (final form). The Untouchable and The Everlasting can be killed with a safe spot, near the exit book. Note: You CANNOT bank after defeating each monster in the quest; you must start over from the first monster, if you leave the rsrc5571. Note that among all the creatures fought in rsrc1829, the Everlasting has the highest rsrc18127. Because rsrc59 is not effective on this monster, a strong stab or range is recommended. A rsrc5525 or rsrc3530 are very effective on this boss. rsrc90 will suffice as well. As for rsrc16810, rsrc2718 along with a rsrc407 and rsrc406 or rsrc1678 and rsrc16339 will work well too.

After the third form, it transforms into this monster, the very last form which you will have to kill. Fighting it can become very tiresome, as players can only hit it once or twice before it disappears and reappears elsewhere. The best way to kill him is with magic, because it works over a longer distance and the illusive is weak to magic attacks. When it is at low health, rsrc5078 will stomp on it and kill it. Now Cyrisus is not afraid of combat anymore. "

She was formerly a human known as Serafina, in which a myth was spread by the rsrc2317 that she had successfully completed the Theatre of Blood and was granted freedom from the vampyres; however, this was simply a ruse to instil false hope into the citizens of rsrc3832 so that they could provide entertainment for the vampyres. As Serafina, she cared deeply for her brother, and she was willing to do anything for him. A rsrc3009 offered to save his life in return for both of them being experimented on, which she accepted. As a result, her brother was transformed into the rsrc12995, while she was warped into the Maiden of Sugadinti, with her mind no longer her own. At 70%, 50%, and 30% hitpoints, the Maiden will spawn 8 rsrc13009, which will walk straight toward her and heal her if they reach her from the northern and the southern walls. To stop this, players can freeze them with the help of rsrc10497 and then killing them while frozen. To properly freeze all healers, only three Nycolas must be frozen early, the most western ones, two north, one south. Then proritize northern third and second south few game ticks before they meet in the center. Once there, the rest will be frozen in the same spot on the consecutive barrage, leaving a clutch of five for ice/blood barrage and three isolated ones. Causing multiple clutches will lead to few leaking to the boss. Every Nycolas that reaches the boss heal it for 200HP and increase the damage of her basic tornado magic attacks. Her tornado attacks are magic based and will only target the closest player to her. Only the tank needs to protect from magic. The Maiden will also throw blood spots at each player dealing large amounts of damage every tick if not dodged while healing the Maiden. Being hit by them will also change into a rsrc13277 which will track randomly around the room, leaving a blood trail behind it also. If a player stands on the trail, it will damage them and heal the Maiden for the same damage taken. It's suggested to clean blood spawns before healer phases and communicate with the team mates to swap gear, heal or restore magic upbefore progressing into the Nycolas phases.  \"Sugadinti\" means \"to ruin\" in Lithuanian."

Located at the Smoke Devil Dungeon south of Castle Wars, the Thermonuclear smoke devil can only be attacked on a smoke devil task, with the exception of one kill for the rsrc1255 (provided that the player has 93 Slayer without boosting). It is the only monster to drop the rsrc1345 and the rsrc11849. Their non-boss variants, however, also drop the rsrc57, albeit at a lower rate. A rsrc984 cannot be used inside the boss room. If attempted, the cannon will be destroyed (similar to areas like at rsrc616 or rsrc2464). Estimated drop rates are based off 2,000 kills.rsrc274 In addition to the drops above, this monster approximately has a 3/128 chance to access the rsrc16088.  The thermonuclear smoke devil was graphically updated on 27 September rsrc231 as part of a rsrc18133. Prior to the update, it was simply a larger version of the smoke devils scattered across the dungeon."

He is rescued during rsrc1400 rsrc15898. After being defeated, Tolna returns to his (original) rsrc2859 form, and is reunited with his parents. He safeguards the rift so that passers-by will not accidentally suffer the same fate he did. He allows players to enter the rift so they can train on the now-stronger creatures they encountered during the quest. The dungeon's power morphed Tolna into a three-headed abomination who is killed in the final part of the quest. All three heads must be defeated. They are rsrc296 and easy to defeat for their level. In addition, if a player poisons one head, then all the heads are poisoned. Each of the three heads, while having the same stats and defence bonuses, have varying attack styles and rsrc10707 that differ depending on whether the player is within melee distance of the heads. For example, the western head does not use melee attacks while the other two heads do.  Tolna's monster form has no chathead. Instead, his dialogue is spoken in the style of being told as a statement. Despite its attack appearing to be one of magic, it is a range attack rather than magic. This is similar to the belief that the rsrc6096 uses a magic attack when it is actually a ranged attack. Tolna are similar to the rsrc17581 in rsrc17582. However, they have no main body like the dead hand. Despite Tolna's western head never using melee attacks, casting rsrc7925 on it reveals that it has a slash attack that attacks every 6 ticks. Tolna's southern head has the slowest known rsrc10707 of any NPC, attacking every 12 seconds when the player is out of its melee attack distance."

He uses rsrc507 equipment, which make him vulnerable to rsrc59 attacks. Torag's set effect is Corruption, which gives him a 25% chance per rsrc813 to lower the player's rsrc1874 by 20%; having 50% energy would result in 10% of it being drained. Torag is often regarded as the easiest brother since his set effect does not pose a notable threat in combat and he is inaccurate compared to the rest of the brothers. He attacks using hammers, so armour defensive against crush is advised. Despite his inaccuracy, he can still hit up to 24 so the use of rsrc1264 is advised for players with low rsrc30. Protect from Melee does not prevent his effect from activating. Torag is commonly defeated with the use of a rsrc1361/rsrc1354, rsrc848 or rsrc1366. Players can also use rsrc8121 or rsrc10497 on Torag to attack him from a distance. "

They can be found northwest of the rsrc370 in the rsrc1530, just north of the swamp. rsrc14140 is in charge of their combat development. When fighting the tortoise with riders, the three gnomes take turns attacking the player. The mage sends a bluish spell towards the player. The ranger shoots a steel arrow at the player, and the tortoise attacks with the driver holding the reins if the player is within their meleeing range. Protection rsrc81 aren't very effective because the riders use all 3 combat styles; however, the tortoises hit hardest with melee, so that prayer will stop the most damage. When the mounted tortoise is slain, the riders, which consist of a level 5 rsrc14139, rsrc14138, and a rsrc14137 spawn. This can prove somewhat dangerous for low levelled (under 80 combat) players, as these gnomes are fairly accurate for their level. If the player runs away, however, they become unaggressive, and eventually disappear when the tortoise respawns. If the player is not in multi combat only the rsrc14138 will attack the player. While in multi combat sometimes the gnomes don't attack the player or only attack one at a time. The Gnomes will cry out for \"Dobbie\", apparently referring to the slain tortoise. They will despawn after around 48 seconds if they are not killed before. The player will not receive combat or hitpoints experience for slaying these gnomes. These items are dropped at the rsrc16656 and rsrc18136.  The Gnome riders named the tortoise Dobbie."

Note that unlike their stronger counterpart rsrc18137, tortured gorillas are not considered rsrc843 for the purposes of a rsrc3482, although they are considered rsrc5922. Below lists the effective drop rates of any specific item.rsrc274 In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550.  "

Tree spirits are notable for being a fairly easy method for rsrc6909 obtaining a rune axe. Previously, tree spirits were a rsrc3360 encountered while training rsrc66.

It is also considered a rsrc1313 for the purposes of a rsrc3482. This tree spirit appears to be weak to fire spells and Earth spells, and has reasonably high melee defence. However, it will die fairly easily if the player hides behind the big yellow mushrooms near the rsrc18138. It can be ranged or maged safely. Also it is not advised to use the rsrc3549 dropped from the rsrc18139 to kill it as the axe is weak and the tree spirit has a really high defence. It's easy to range the Dramen Tree spirit because it seems to have low defence against ranged. rsrc1685, unstrung rsrc18140 and rsrc16448 are allowed on the island. Simply string the bow when you reach the dungeon. For those who prefer not to use ranged or magic attacks, the rsrc1129 is an option.

He has the power to possess objects around him and send them hurtling towards players. He is summoned when the player attempts to pick up the rsrc18141. He uses these three main attacks: He can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete, although in there, he will not have any obstacles to command and is therefore very easy to kill, especially with rsrc78. rsrc16630 had the rsrc710 destroyed after the holy rsrc2963 started to seep into the lower shaft of the mine. Although most of the water was tainted by the land's twisted soil, some remained pure and retained rsrc1222's blessing. Purple crystals were growing in the mine and absorbed the blessing. When exposed to the unholy creatures of the land, the crystals would severely weaken or even kill them. To prevent the crystals from falling into the hands of Saradominists, Drakan then imprisoned Treus Dayth, who was one of his followers, to guard the crystals on the lowest level. Even after Treus Dayth died, his tortured soul continued to serve as the mine's guardian. The crystals are known to players as the rsrc1086 or rsrc271. Treus Dayth has a nasty habit of teleporting in spots where the machinery can hit you. All that needs to be done is look where he is standing, and carefully walk around equipment to get to him. He can be difficult to fight for multiple reasons: The player will take substantial damage constantly; if it's not the mine carts or the cranes, it's the pickaxes that will hit you anywhere you are in the room. rsrc3014 helps since his attack style is rsrc78-based, although this merely reduces damage, and his attacks are still quite damaging. Using rsrc18142 is also a good idea as the boss fight is extremely long because of how he moves around. Having to walk around whilst being hit by the mine carts and cranes is quite deadly, especially if the player is low-levelled. Note that the rsrc825 spell is quite effective and viable. Because of all the obstacles in the room, using rsrc59 or Ranged will often require that you stand next to him to be able to attack, so it is best you use your strongest attack style as each is essentially limited to rsrc507 range. For lower levels who have access to rsrc825, using this with rsrc16144 may be the easiest method. Since Treus Dayth has negative magic defence, players can still hit even when wearing armour like Rune. Having more defensive armour than something like rsrc4666 can drastically reduce damage taken from the surroundings.  Treus Dayth counts as a ghost for a slayer task to kill ghosts, so the damage boosts from a rsrc1710 or rsrc282 are applied."

    "article-text": "Troll generals are huge and powerful rsrc2504 that live in the rsrc4253, on the top floor. Troll generals have a reasonably high drop rate of rsrc1100 and rsrc2768. This can be advantageous for players wishing to rsrc18144 drops such as rsrc18145 and rsrc389 for profit. As a slayer task, Troll generals are a convenient, higher-level choice when assigned rsrc2504. They have a reasonably high drop rate of nature runes and weapons and armour, including the occasional rsrc4571. Troll Generals have surprisingly low accuracy. Nevertheless, high levelled melee armour (such as rsrc16290) is still recommended if not using prayer, as they can hit extremely hard (up to 38). Therefore, use of the rsrc1264 prayer is strongly recommended. It is possible to use rsrc78 or rsrc59 attacks on the generals safely, as their large size allows them to be corner rsrc16455. Water spells work best on them (if using rsrc862, wear rsrc4289) and rsrc442 work fairly well. Extreme caution is advised at all times, as they can leave their respective rooms, although this is a rare occurrence, and they only attack if the player walks right next to them. It is possible to poison them, run out of their range, and let the poison do most of the work. The Troll general in the far north-west room can be safe spotted by standing in the corridor between his bed and the wall. He cannot enter that corridor and can be ranged or maged. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550. "

They drop herbs and seeds commonly, though not as frequently as rsrc623, as well as frequent rsrc2768. Turoths, like rsrc614, can only be damaged with a rsrc7502, rsrc3530 or rsrc5414, the rsrc1366 spell (requiring a rsrc59 level of 50 and either a rsrc1350 or a rsrc276), rsrc973 or rsrc409 (which can only be fired from a rsrc407, rsrc978, rsrc977, or an rsrc974), or by using rsrc18146 (which can only be fired from a rsrc1678, rsrc4597, or rsrc1671). Turoths are immune to other types of attacks, thereby establishing hidden skill requirements to kill them (particularly for rsrc6909). Turoths and kurasks are the only monsters to drop the rsrc3530. Drops up to 3 random herbs at a time. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550. "

Tyras guards are all equipped with a Steel rsrc498 as a weapon, therefore a player can be attacked either next to the Guard or one square away. A Tyras Guard is fought during the rsrc495 quest. A Tyras Guard can hit up to 15 and though there are a few \"rsrc17830\", his rsrc498 can reach over most of them, so food is strongly advised. Protect from melee will prevent a Tyras guard from damaging the player, however those lacking prayer levels and/or points will need another strategy. rsrc59 or rsrc120 can be dangerous to use because most robes have low defence and there is a lack of rsrc17830, but it has proven to be effective. If using rsrc120, a player can attack with rsrc10497 so the Guard cannot move, which is highly effective because of his weakness to Magic, and binding the guard results in most if not all damage being avoided during the fight. Players as low as 13 Magic (to cast rsrc17855) should have little difficulty dispatching a Tyras guard provided they can find a safespot. Alternatively, a player with high melee stats (60+) along with a decent weapon and armour may be able to successfully fight a Tyras guard hand-to-hand.

Some will have no weapon wielded, while some wield up to three rsrc2454 to accompany, or a rsrc6636. While fighting TzHaar-Ket, players can go into the rsrc15996 and die to fully heal themselves and recharge rsrc81. They are more popular to kill than rsrc8352, despite their higher defence and rsrc65, due to dropping more valuable obsidian items such as the rsrc6636 and rsrc2457. All TzHaar have an uncommon chance to drop rsrc1948, rsrc1946, and rsrc1951 as well as a rare chance to drop rsrc1952. You can safespot the TzHaar-Ket by standing behind a Sulphur Vent south-west of the entrance of rsrc6114 using range or magic. There are stronger TzHaar-Ket located in the rsrc15251. In order to fight these, a rsrc6107 must be shown to any TzHaar-Ket guard near the barrier (these guards are unattackable). "

TzHaar-Xil are the second strongest race in TzHaar, excluding some rsrc17921 monsters. The meleers can conveniently be ranged or maged from safespots around the various rsrc18148 and fissures in the cave, though this is harder due to the fact that they are spread out more and the lack of safespots. Their appearance is small relative to other TzHaar creatures, and they are coloured black/red. The TzHaar-Xil that is slighter taller and wielding the Toktz-xil-ul will stop attacking for one turn when switching between ranged and melee attack styles. Players using protection prayers should bear this in mind when fighting them. Fighting the TzHaar-Xil which wields a set of Toktz-xil-ul is not recommended, as their ranged attack hits higher (up to 16) and more often than its melee attack. "

    "article-text": "TzKal-Zuk is the last monster encountered in the rsrc6113, and currently the second strongest monster in rsrc1469. According to rsrc6108, TzKal-Zuk is the apparent leader of the feral rsrc8354 in the Inferno. Players can pay 100 rsrc293 to have rsrc7309 or rsrc5775 assign rsrc8354 as a rsrc285 assignment. When players have TzHaar as a slayer task, they will be prompted with an option to be assigned 1 rsrc3483 or 1 TzKal-Zuk; the latter requires having killed TzKal-Zuk at least once before being able to have him assigned. Players who succeed in defeating him will receive 101,890 slayer experience. As TzKal-Zuk is isolated from the platform the player is on, he cannot be attacked with melee. Only ranged or magic attacks will be able to reach him. The rsrc1671 is the most effective weapon to use against TzKal-Zuk, followed by rsrc974. The rsrc1695 is also recommended for killing the minions that appear during the fight. During the fight, a shield will appear to protect the player from TzKal-Zuk's attacks. The shield has 600 hitpoints and will move, so players will need to move alongside it to avoid taking damage from TzKal-Zuk. If the player does not get behind the shield when TzKal-Zuk attacks, they run the possibility of taking massive damage from its attacks. It is possible for TzKal-Zuk's attacks to miss or deal survivable damage, though this should not be relied on. rsrc4844 does not work against TzKal-Zuk. The toxic blowpipe's short range may lure the player out of the shield's protection when attacking a monster, so caution should be exercised when wielding it. In addition to this, a rsrc10826 and rsrc10820 will appear periodically throughout the fight and attack the shield. It is imperative to keep them off the shield, as if the shield is destroyed, the player's chances of survival are essentially zero. Pray accordingly against the 2 and focus on TzKal-Zuk once both minions are killed. When TzKal-Zuk reaches 480 hitpoints, a rsrc10628 will appear and attack the shield. Tag and kill it immediately as leaving it alive can be problematic, especially when more Jal-Xil and Jal-Zeks reappear. At 240 hitpoints, 4 rsrc13241 will appear from the lava and start healing TzKal-Zuk. The Jal-MejJaks will heal about 25 hitpoints on average, and will quickly heal TzKal-Zuk if not attacked. Once attacked, the Jal-MejJak will attack the area in front of it, dealing 8-10 damage with their AoE attacks. Kill the Jal-MejJaks before focusing on TzKal-Zuk again. It is best to wait for the Jal-Xil and Jal-Zek to respawn again before triggering the appearance of the Jal-MejJaks to kill the healers without much inconvenience. The toxic blowpipe is the strongest weapon against the Jal-MejJaks. Any remaining minions when TzKal-Zuk is killed will automatically die with him. Once players manage to beat TzKal-Zuk, they will be rewarded with the much-coveted rsrc5318 along with 16,440 rsrc703 (doubled if the player has completed the Elite tier of the rsrc1500). The infernal cape is untradeable, so it is a very clear symbol to other players that the player has defeated this mighty foe. There is also a 1/100 chance of receiving a rsrc7083 rsrc3463 upon defeating it. Outside, players may give rsrc6108 any unwanted infernal capes for a 2nd chance at a Jal-nib-rek, having also a 1/100 chance."

    "article-text": "TzTok-Jad, commonly called Jad for short, is one of the rsrc10809 in Old School RuneScape. With a rsrc173 of 702, TzTok-Jad has a max hit of 97 and can easily kill most players in one hit with any of its three attacks: a rsrc507 attack with its huge claws, a blast of rsrc59 in the form of a fireball, and an avalanche of boulders falling from the ceiling as a rsrc78 attack. To add to the challenge, players must fight TzTok-Jad solo without being able to restock on supplies from the previous waves. Players can pay 100 rsrc293 to have rsrc7309, rsrc5775, or rsrc6317 assign rsrc8354 as a rsrc3482. When players have TzHaar as a slayer assignment, they will be prompted with an option to be assigned 1 TzTok-Jad. Players who succeed in defeating it will receive 25,250 rsrc285 experience. TzTok-Jad is the boss monster of the rsrc4994 minigame, so he is the last monster you will need to defeat, and he is encountered on Wave 63. This is the only place where Jad can be found. Although rsrc2868 suggests that players take short breaks in between playing and encourages players not to spend large amounts of time on the game, battling your way to TzTok-Jad often requires at least 90 minutes of consecutive gameplay. Previously, logging out during the fight caused the minigame to end and forced players to restart. Now, you simply press the logout button once, and a notification will tell you the minigame will be paused at the end of the current wave. You can then logout and when you return, a new wave will begin. A player should not depend on this logging out break, however, because if he or she is at the later stages where he or she is fighting multiple deadly high levels (such as the rsrc10824), the player generally spawns next to or on top of the monsters. The chatbox that opens upon logging back in stalls the monsters from spawning until clicking to continue (or by pressing spacebar). Once TzTok-Jad is reached, fighting and defeating him requires a lot of skill and decent reflexes with the mouse. It is possible to engage TzTok-Jad using rsrc507, but it requires skill to switch between the rsrc1264, rsrc3014, and rsrc5495 prayers (only recommended for players with much experience). TzTok-Jad uses all three types of rsrc16727 to engage the player. Therefore, a combination of rsrc78 attacks and rsrc81 is usually preferred. A sharp eye and swift reflexes are necessary to stand any chance of defeating this monster. TzTok-Jad has a very long rsrc76, much like the rsrc13235 encountered earlier on in the Fight Cave. A very useful tip is to try to find out where the orange Ket-Zek spawned in the previous wave. As with all other waves where two enemies of the same type are encountered, the new monster will appear where the off-coloured monster spawned. This will allow you to prepare accordingly to prevent Jad from launching a surprise attack. TzTok-Jad will use either rsrc59 or rsrc78 attacks to defeat a player that is not meleeing him. It is critical that players know the warning signs for these attacks and switch between the protection prayers accordingly before the attack lands: All of TzTok-Jad's attacks can deal up to 97 damage. While this means rsrc1128 can deal a lot of damage, one extremely high-damaging hit can mean the fight is over, especially if the rsrc13238 are attacking you. Monsters move east or west before moving north or south to reach you. This is very useful when trying to trap TzTok-Jad when it spawns. Once TzTok-Jad is reduced to half health, he will summon four Yt-HurKots to come and heal him repeatedly - the player must deal with them whilst warding off TzTok-Jad's attacks. If they manage to heal him to full health, then they should not be killed as they will respawn once he is reduced to half health again. If they are distracted before healing him to full health, they will not respawn when killed. Once players manage to defeat TzTok-Jad they will be rewarded with the much-coveted rsrc6107 along with 8,032 rsrc703 (16,064 Tokkul with completion of the rsrc17199). The fire cape is untradeable, so it is a very clear symbol to other players that the player has defeated this mighty foe. The fire cape, rsrc5318 and their cosmetically enhanced variants, the rsrc6112 and rsrc7086 respectively, are the only capes to have an animation. Players may gamble any unwanted fire capes with rsrc6109 for either 8,000 Tokkul or a second chance at rsrc6110, having the same reward rate as killing Jad off-task."

It is a good idea for players to turn on rsrc1264 to avoid the use of rsrc184. His rsrc10706 is rather low compared to monsters of a similar rsrc173, with the fact that Ulfric is inaccurate, makes him a very easy boss for players about his level. Ulfric Longbeard was once a rsrc3936 sailor who collected treasure. However, some treasures were cursed. A few years ago, several ships, including Ulfric's, were destroyed along the shores of the rsrc10178. The survivors found a cave on a cliff far east of rsrc678 where they decided to stash the remaining treasure from their ships. Ulfric and his men died soon afterwards. Later, rsrc9859 created a treasure map to the entrance of the cave. This map eventually came to be in the hands of rsrc4970 and comes into players' hands during rsrc3507. "

If a lumberjack clothing piece does not drop you can wait for a new group to spawn if the last one did not give a clothing piece. Only one unique drop will be dropped per trip. It is however possible to get multiple pieces from one event if you kill the lumberjacks at the same time. A Dragon Halberd special attack is a good option to kill more at once. Barrages work too. They do not give any combat experience. The outfit is obtained in the following order: "

Both rsrc1328 and rsrc3711 undead ones are found in rsrc2470 and rsrc2354, whereas the zombie undead ones are also found at the entrance to rsrc3139. They are decent training for people using rsrc78, rsrc59, or a rsrc498. When killed, some release a gas that can damage for 2-3 rsrc65 over time. However, it is not poisonous, so rsrc1037 is not required. The gas only affects characters in a one-square radius around where the undead one was when it was killed, so if players kill one, they have a few seconds to run to avoid taking damage. The skeletal undead ones do not release this gas. They can be used as a substitution for rsrc3711 or rsrc1328 as a rsrc3482, depending on which ones are killed, for higher-levelled players who wish to get more rsrc19 from their task. They barely have any drops, and so are rarely killed. Players can earn around 37,000-40,000 rsrc712 experience per hour fighting undead ones.  Some rsrc3711 undead ones carry a rsrc16659, a type of weapon used by the rsrc18152 rsrc18153. The undead ones wearing masks make the same sounds as rsrc1328, despite being zombies. Similarly, the skeletal undead ones holding rsrc16567 and round rsrc15904 make zombie sounds. This might be a glitch."

A player can create a unicow by activating the altar (found in the north-west part of the basement) while having a rsrc4913 and a rsrc4917 in their inventory. The rsrc10689 in the dungeon then creates the monster, which appears near the altar and will attack the player. Taking too long to kill will result in the disappearance of the unicow. Players can train very efficiently on unicows. Approximately 40 rsrc28, rsrc64, and rsrc30 are needed to do this. Go to the altar for the unicow, and activate the altar while having a rsrc4913 and rsrc4917 in the inventory. Kill the unicow for decent experience; they have low Attack and Strength. Pick up a unicorn horn to use next inventory. Around 14 cowhides are needed to obtain a full inventory of unicorn horns. Horns will always drop in noted form if you have completed all Medium Tasks in Ardougne Diary. You do not have to bring your cloak to get noted horns, but you will need to bring unnoted horns to summon unicows. This is a great method for training and making cash as it is rarely crowded, and people cannot steal your kills. Some relatively fast ways to bank are to run back to the rsrc16021 next to the tower and bank in rsrc3820, teleport to the rsrc1622 with the rsrc6485 and bank at rsrc430 with a rsrc3845, though an rsrc1637 (with rsrc18156 to save space) could also be used.

They can only be harmed by silver weapons or rsrc5719, and can be defeated by using the special attack of the rsrc2325 or rsrc4271 and a dose of rsrc1051 potion when it is below half health. This can result in the juvinate dying, reverting to human, or turning into an even more powerful rsrc18157 (which are vulnerable to weapons other than silver). If the juvinate reverts into a human, they will thank you and give you a reward. Alternatively, if you don't have an Ivandis flail, you can lower the health of a juvinate enough for it to flee. This way, you will not have to use a charge on your Rod of Ivandis. When a juvinate reaches about 1/3 health, they will disappear and turn into a cloud of mist and say \"Ha, ha, ha, time to disappear and re-juvinate!\" A good strategy in Temple Trekking is to attack them with a ranged or magic attack immediately when they appear so they don't have a chance of attacking your follower. If there are too many for you to attack, try moving to maneuver them into an obstacle to ensure that it will not attack your follower. You must attack them before they attack your follower, otherwise the only way to stop it is by killing it. This can take some time due to how weak silver weapons are. Your follower may run out of food if you take too long to kill it. Another good strategy to use is to fight them with rsrc3204. Depending on your rsrc78 level, this may actually be a much faster way to kill juvinates than using a Rod of Ivandis. It is also very easy to rsrc16428 them with the large amount of plants and water in the area. When successfully returning a Juvinate to human, rsrc14921, rsrc14920, rsrc14919 or rsrc14924 will hand the player a noted reward. If the Juvinate was returned to a human in rsrc3832, a rsrc14922 will appear instead. "

Each Vanguard is weak to a specific attack attack style: Upon defeat of all three Vanguards, the rsrc10191 will appear on the ground, giving the player some insight as to how the Vanguard came to be. The three Vanguards originally spawn underground. When a player gets near one of the holes, all three will burst from the ground. All Vanguards attack three times with each attack; however, the rsrc59 and rsrc78 Vanguards use AoE attacks (one always hitting the player while two are launched elsewhere). The rsrc507 Vanguard simply attacks the player three times for every attack it performs. To harm the Vanguards, damage must be spread equally to all three Vanguards. If just one of the Vanguard is heavily damaged while the others have much higher health (at least 34% or higher), all the Vanguards will heal themselves back to full health upon shuffling. To stop this from occurring, the Vanguards' health must be within 33% of the other Vanguards by the time they shuffle positions. Stomp damage is applied to players under them when they shuffle; this damage will not occur when they attack players. It should be noted that the ranged Vanguard is static, and will be unable to attack players that are under it. The melee and magic Vanguards will attempt to move out if the player is under them. In addition to this, if a Vanguard reaches 0 health at the same moment it shuffles, it will restore 1 health rather than dying."

After they were found in the rsrc8624 quest, Vanstrom came and brutally murdered two Myreque members, but the rest managed to escape and flee.

Vasa Nistirio is initially seen as a pile of rocks. Upon approaching the pile, he will animate himself and start the fight. He will also raise a purple flame at the entrance, which will damage players who pass through it. For teams, the player with the least amount of rsrc65 should initiate the battle in rsrc17873 and stand next to him; then, teammates should cross the flame and rsrc18158 next to him. After his rsrc17598 attack, players can rsrc18159. It is recommended to use the rsrc3014 prayer, as while walking to the crystals, Vasa will throw rocks at the team, which can deal significant damage. Fortunately, these rocks can be avoided by running away from the spot they are thrown at (the rocks have a 3x3 AoE). Throughout the fight, Vasa will move towards a cluster of crystals, which are located in the corners of the room. These crystals will heal Vasa, so it is important to target them as quick as possible to minimise the amount of healing he can perform. They are weak to rsrc15937 attacks. If the crystals are not destroyed in time, Vasa will use his special attack upon returning to the middle of the room. Otherwise, he will walk to another set of crystals. Vasa has a special attack where he will teleport everyone in the room. Half of the team will be teleported to the edges, while the remaining half will be teleported next to him (if soloing, you will always be teleported to him). Those next to him will be rsrc3080 and have their prayers disabled. Those teleported to the edges should run to the center and active rsrc5495. Vasa will unleash a magical barrage against everyone next to him, dealing massive damage. Players inside of the attack with Protect from Magic on will take 0 damage and reduce the damage dealt to the players who are stunned by half. He is immune to attacks while charging his special attack. It is unknown how the damage works, though it seems to be scaled based on the team's current average Hitpoints. A quick counter against this attack is to \"tick eat\"; eating rsrc184 (or a drinking a brew) just before the barrage hits. Quickly heal back up though, as Vasa will start throwing rocks after performing his special attack. Players under Vasa will take rapid stomp damage from him. "

She is able to drain rsrc81 as well as perform a lethal rsrc3080 attack that can hit up to 50 damage, and may combine it with another attack if the player does not have rsrc5495 active, which is capable of instantly killing the player. Unlike the other rsrc464 bosses, Venenatis' lethal attack has a chance of failing. Venenatis is immune to Magic damage, although spells with effects such as rsrc8125 will still affect her.  She was a player-suggested rsrc1708, which was adopted into the game after a substantial amount of positive forum feedback. The term Venenatis comes from the Latin \"Ven\u0113n\u0101tis\", which means \"Venomous\" or \"Poisoned\". If Venenatis is attacked while she is in a rsrc18160, she will only take 1-8 damage from the player's attacks regardless of their rsrc16421. This is because her habitat is surrounded by a single-way area, and all of the rsrc16541 (excluding rsrc16542) reside in rsrc18161. Players can still deal full damage to her while standing in the single-way area if she remains in a multi-way area. On release, the tree stump found south-east of the trees in 24 Wilderness was one square south than what it is now. This was changed in an update in order to prevent players rsrc16428 Venenatis behind the trees. However, it can still be done, albeit with a lot more effort. If Venenatis is lured south near rsrc5445 and attacks a player with her multi-target Magic attack, any nearby players in the single-way combat zone already in combat with another entity will also be hit. This may be an oversight by Jagex."

    "article-text": "Verac the Defiled is the youngest of the six rsrc5439. Verac's crypt is located to the north-west of the rsrc797 area. He uses rsrc507 equipment, which make him vulnerable to rsrc59 attacks. Verac's set effect is Defiler, which gives him a 25% chance per attack to ignore rsrc30, rsrc4920 bonuses and rsrc7104. Despite being able to hit through rsrc1264, it is still recommended as it negates on average 75% of his attacks and when the set effect does activate, lowers his max hit from 23 to 15. He attacks using a flail, so armour defensive against crush is advised if not using Protect from Melee and taking hits from Verac. He can be seen as one the most tedious Barrows brothers to deal with since he is the only brother who cannot be alleviated solely by protection prayers, possibly requiring rsrc184 too. Verac is commonly defeated with the use of a rsrc1361/rsrc1354, rsrc848 or rsrc1366. Players can also use rsrc8121 or rsrc10497 on Verac to attack him from a distance.  Unlike a player using rsrc1125, a purple aura does not appear when his set effect activates."

She is the final boss of the rsrc1573, and currently the strongest monster in RuneScape. Verzik Vitur was the head of the Vitur family on her homeworld of rsrc1571, and arrived in rsrc3096 alongside many other rsrc2317 during the rsrc10219 by rsrc1210, who the vampyres refer to as the \"Stranger from Afar\". Before her departure, she had domesticated a large number of rsrc12901, which she brought with her to Gielinor. It is known that she aided rsrc16630 in conquering rsrc2264 during the rsrc1760, in which she was given rsrc13637's castle for her aid. This castle would become known as rsrc5555. She greatly enjoys blood sports, often demanding entertainment on the spot from her army of vampyres. Eventually, it became tiresome, so she instructed a construction of the rsrc1573, in which the most fearsome creatures would be placed for challengers to fight them. She also created an extensive breeding program for her nylocas, which resulted in three new types of Nylocas. One of these Nylocas bit her, which granted her new abilities but also made her obese and vulnerable to non-silver weaponry. Verzik makes a small appearance in rsrc2982, where she gives rsrc4199 and rsrc3009 an rsrc12995 to help them hunt down rsrc8980. To initiate the fight, a player must first talk to Verzik Vitur. She will have 3 phases:  \"V\u00e9rzik\" directly translates to \"bleeding\" in Hungarian."

It is a parasitic wasp from the Abyss that rsrc5146 and his followers stumbled upon when attempting to open a new dimensional tear. Use rsrc3014, and attack with rsrc78. Vespula can rsrc296 players starting at 20 damage, so a rsrc18162 or another form of poison protection is highly recommended. In addition, septic tentacles will spawn near the entrance, dealing moderate poison damage (will not cause poison) to those who pass it once the fight starts. The chamber contains rsrc7878, which need to be fed rsrc7876, which are also found in the same chamber. The grubs have a health bar, which will constantly degrade. If their health reaches 0, they will turn into rsrc13875, fully healing both Vespula and the portal. For this reason, it is recommended that at least one member of the team focuses solely on feeding blossoms to the grubs. When Vespula reaches 20% of its health, she will stop flying, and can only be harmed with melee. During this time, the team should focus their attacks on the rsrc13863. rsrc18163 can be very effective against the portal. After a short time, Vespula will go back to flying, and the team should refocus on her. While it is possible to attack the portal at any time, it will cause Vespula to become enraged, using her stinger to attack anyone nearby for high damage. This can be avoided by staying away from melee distance or going under her, though doing the latter will cause rapid stomp damage of up to 8 per tick instead. When the portal is destroyed, Vespula and the lux grubs will fall with it, ending the encounter. "

Like other bosses in the rsrc464, he can also drop the rsrc96. Vet'ion has two forms: the (purple) regular form and the (orange) reborn form. After he is defeated in his first form, he will go to his second form. His stats or abilities do not change between forms. If he is not killed within five minutes in his second form, he will revert to his first form with the same hitpoints. Vet'ion is highly resistant to any combat style other than crush, and as he is undead, he is susceptible to rsrc1086 and its rsrc271 version. He is immune to rsrc59 damage, but spells with effects such as rsrc8125 still work on him. Vet'ion primarily uses a rsrc507 that can target players up to three tiles away from him. He also frequently uses an unblockable but avoidable rsrc17598 attack that launches three lightning bolts, one at the targeted player and two randomly somewhere nearby. Lastly, he sometimes uses an earthquake attack that can hit all players nearby for up to 45, which cannot be avoided or blocked. When he reaches half health, he will summon two level 214 rsrc9173 to aid him. On the second form, they are level 281 rsrc9170 instead. Similar to Vet'ion, they are weak to crush and Salve amulet, and they only attack with melee. The hellhounds must be killed as Vet'ion is immune to damage if they are alive. Vet'ion will exclaim several quotes throughout the fight:  On release, Vet'ion would use his rsrc59 attack more frequently. This was changed in rsrc17735 on 8 February rsrc231. Vet'ion's model is an enlarged, re-coloured version of rsrc4438 from the rsrc192. Vet'ion is an anagram of rsrc18164, because of his purple armour. Vet'ion's examine is a reference to Tolkien's rsrc18165."

    "article-text": "Viyeldi is a spirit encountered during the rsrc192, when rsrc2535 - disguised as rsrc16526 - asks you to kill him. When you first enter his room, Viyeldi pretends to be a rsrc3098 on the ground until picked up. Upon beginning a conversation with him, he informs you of a different path you could take in the quest. You can choose to carry out Nezikchened's request, and kill Viyeldi using the rsrc3643 that Echned Zekin gives you at the source of the holy water spring, or you could listen to him, and kill the warriors for the fragments of the rsrc4434 to progress. Killing Viyeldi, while quicker, results in a more difficult final fight, as you will have to defeat the three warriors rsrc4436, rsrc4435, and rsrc4438 alongside Nezikchened in the fight. You can avoid this if you listen to Viyeldi and give the dagger to rsrc190 instead, and kill the warriors. Ungadulu will also give you a rsrc5133 card to use against Nezikchened and weaken him in the next two fights. If you do kill Viyeldi with the dagger, then you can still give the rsrc3642 to Ungadulu to receive the holy force card. Just remember that this route results in the three warriors appearing in the final battle. Whichever option you take, be prepared to fight the demon after this section of the quest. See the quest guide for more information. "

    "article-text": "Post-quest Dragon Slayer II                                                 Vorkath (roughly translated as pathetic failure/weakling/runt in the rsrc1234's language) is a draconic rsrc1708 first encountered during the rsrc230 quest as the penultimate boss. Created by rsrc1237 during the rsrc5486's rsrc18166, the blue dragon is one of his subjects that have survived his experiments in the laboratory beneath the rsrc1234 fortress on rsrc1259. Despite its phenomenal strength, he notes that it lacked the aggression he desired, and abandons it to guard the fortress from invading human forces as a \"little distraction\". The quest variant of Vorkath is significantly weaker than his post-quest counterpart; however, both share the same attacks. After the quest, a stronger variant of Vorkath may be fought. Both the quest and post-quest fights take place in an rsrc11750; if the player dies battling Vorkath, they can pay 100,000 coins to rsrc5491 to reclaim their items. If the player dies elsewhere before reclaiming their items, their unclaimed items will be permanently lost. In addition to this, Torfinn's holding capabilities do not stack with others (e.g rsrc688, rsrc426), so if players have items being held by one of these fights and dies to Vorkath, the items there will be lost. Vorkath is considered a rsrc708 for the purpose of a rsrc3482. As Vorkath is also rsrc277, the rsrc1086 and its variants will work on him. However, it does not stack with the rsrc282. Vorkath uses a variety of attacks, primarily range and mage attacks, as well as melee if standing next to him. He can also use three types of dragonfire: regular, rsrc1342, and prayer-disabling kind. His dragonfire is stronger than other dragons' and requires more tiers of protection to block. The final common attack is a fireball he launches high in the air that must be dodged or it will deal substantial damage. Occasionally (after six normal/dragonfire attacks), he will use one of two special attacks and alternate between them: Once Vorkath is killed, he will return to his original pose, and if Dragon Slayer II is completed, can be re-woken for another battle. In addition to the 100% drop, the player will also have two rolls on Vorkath's drop table. This excludes unique items such as rsrc11830, rsrc1462 and rsrc15918.  Originally, the post-quest Vorkath had 640 rsrc65. This was changed to 1,000 with increased stats due to players being able to use a tactic in order to deal damage during the poison pool attack without taking any damage. Kill times were reset following this fix. Many players criticised this, as it made Vorkath incredibly hard to kill, especially for players who could not afford a rsrc2134 or were off-task. As a result, Vorkath's health was reduced to 750 the following day, with any damage dealt to him during the poison pool attack being reduced. In addition, it also made the rsrc1086 and its variants work against him. Like the first hotfix, kill times were reset again. Due to player requests of how poor Vorkath's drops were given the time needed to kill it, several of Vorkath's drops were increased, and given the ability to roll for two drops at a time. However, player complaints about how overpowered it was and the drop values being similar to rsrc688 caused fears of items crashing, so some of the more lucrative drops were reduced as a result. The same update also increased the damage players could deal to Vorkath during his poison pool attack, up to 50% of their maximum hit.

The same update also increased the damage players could deal to Vorkath during his poison pool attack, up to 50% of their maximum hit. Vorkath's post-quest examine is a reference to a similar saying Let sleeping dogs lie, which means to avoid interfering with situations where nothing is currently wrong."

    "article-text": "A wall beast is a rsrc285 monster that requires level 35 Slayer to kill. A rsrc9540 or rsrc282 is required to start fighting one. Players without 5 rsrc30 would not be rsrc3482 these as 5 Defence is required to wear the helmet. This monster is not very popular, due to the fact that its drops are poor with the exception of the rsrc1278. It is found only in the rsrc4125. Be sure to bring a rope and a rsrc15946. This creature is infamous for surprising, and sometimes killing, low-level players who are traversing through the Lumbridge Swamp Caves. To avoid the Wall beasts, simply run past the \"Hole in the walls\", avoiding the tile they are adjacent to. Wall beasts can be a good source of rsrc6737 due to the fact that it's the only rsrc1646 they drop. Players should wear a rsrc9540 or rsrc282 whilst fighting wall beasts, otherwise they will grab them by the head and slam them against the wall, removing up to 18 hitpoints. If players wear a spiny helmet, the grabbing attack will fail, allowing them to be fought normally. A wall beast's maximum hit on a player wearing a spiny helmet is 4. You may also wear the rsrc282, as it is combined with the spiny helmet. The spiny helmet is only required to initiate combat with a wall beast. Once it has started attacking normally, it can no longer grab the player's head, allowing a rsrc1710 to be used. The wall beast does not count as a large monster and therefore the rsrc5001's special attack does not produce two hits on it. The best location to slay these is in the southwest corner of the dungeon where there are two spawns located extremely close to one another. It is easy and effective to simply run back and forth between each spawn after completing a kill. In addition, you can quickly make a beast reappear by leaving the dungeon and entering it again, making the beast located west of the entrance available to slay again. Despite their relatively high level, wall beasts have a low max hit and can easily be killed by a player with low combat."

    "article-text": "Wallasalkis can be found throughout the rsrc1599. They attack with powerful rsrc59 and their projectile resembles rsrc842. Their magic attack can hit into the high 20s, so rsrc5495 is highly recommended when fighting them. They may start to run away from the attacking player, similar to rsrc18167, after being damaged to below half health. A good spot to kill them is at the narrow pathway just before the barricades at the central room in sublevel 1. After they develop their rsrc10710 toward a player he or she may kill as many as desired and use the narrow pathway and other nearby wall structures to trap themselves from moving out of the tolerance area. Wallasalkis drops include the raw materials required for rsrc5083. They also drop various runes, similar to most magical monsters. Wallasalki can be good experience for high level ranged training. They have high hitpoints and low ranged defence. If training, it is advised to bring prayer potions for rsrc5495. If you are using prayer, try to find a good armour setup so that you have high melee attack bonus, and a high prayer bonus, but be especially careful of your health since large amounts of Wallasalkis will be attacking you at once. If using melee it is advised to use a two-handed slashing weapon such as a rsrc1709. It should be noted that good xp rates are only obtained while they are aggressive. This is a great (and one of the few) ways to use a cannon for experience and to reduce its operating cost at the same time. Try to bring a friend to train with you, since you need a partner to open the gate. Two people training while splitting the drops will actually get you more money per hour than by yourself, and this is even more true when both players place a cannon at or near the same location. The best place to use a dwarf multicannon would be right after using the ladder to go down from level 1. There are only 3 Wallasalkis here, and they are usually not targeted. No other monsters will interrupt your training. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550."

Warrior women are an infrequently used alternative to thieving from rsrc16749 at lower levels. This method is useful in Ardougne due to their closeness to a food source, the rsrc3506.

On the North of the building, you will see a trellis (18 agility required). Climb the trellis, and then you will find yourself on the middle floor of the Watchtower, with some Watchmen walking around."

It will cast rsrc868 when attacked and will heal itself if it is damaged with rsrc10543 (such as Water Strike, rsrc862, etc). The water wizard is especially effective against rsrc507 as it can also cast rsrc3185.  Just like the other three wizards, the water wizard does not drop rsrc2071. Instead, it drops rsrc175.

    "article-text": "Waterfiends can be found in the rsrc1289 underneath the rsrc160 and in the rsrc7425. Waterfiends are moderately resistant to all forms of combat with the exception of crush attacks, which they are significantly more vulnerable against. They use a magic attack whose projectile resembles rsrc831, along with a magical ranged attack resembling rsrc7042. rsrc7309 is the only Slayer master who assigns waterfiends, and they are an uncommon assignment. To unlock player must have entered Ancient cavern. rsrc274 Killing a waterfiend is a requirement for an rsrc92. The simplest way to reach waterfiends is by accessing the Ancient Cavern, found south of the rsrc2215. A games necklace allows for easy trips to the bank. Because waterfiends use both magic and ranged, circumventing all of their damage through protection prayers is not possible. However, both of their attacks are rolled against the player's total magic resistance. Therefore, only armour to provide magic defence bonus, such as rsrc3050 or rsrc1126, is helpful when fighting waterfiends. Using crush attacks is ideal for dealing damage. If a crush weapon is not available, some high level weapons, such as the rsrc247, possess a secondary crush attack which is sufficient given the very low crush defence bonus of waterfiends. Alternatively, ranged is also effective as most magic-resistant armour also provides a substantial ranged attack bonus. Once waterfiends rsrc10710, they can be trapped and rsrc16428 in some locations within the Ancient Cavern. The rsrc794, which has an extraordinarily long attack distance, can be used to safespot waterfiends over larger bodies of water. Using rsrc3014 is recommended for those struggling to defend against waterfiends. Many of the waterfiends' drops are ideal for casting rsrc8 on. This monsters drops seeds from the rsrc14052. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550.  "

They appear as normal humans until they are attacked in which they transform into level 88 werewolves, unless the player wields a rsrc2911, in which case they remain human. In either case they drop rsrc3298. They can hit up to 8 as a werewolf, and up to 2 as a human. If you are a lower level player (70-) training on them you may want food as their attacks are accurate. They only count towards rsrc3482 when killed in the werewolf form, not their human forms. There is a strategy that can work to reduce damage when killing these for slayer, though. Start the fight with the rsrc17725 equipped, then when the werewolf's health is low, switch to a different weapon. It will regain some health in the transformation to wolf form, but still be low, and will ultimately cause less damage than fighting as a wolf the entire time.  Another way to safely complete a werewolf slayer task is to set up a Dwarf Cannon in the village, run into a house, and close the door.  The Werewolves will agro to you and stack up at the door, but as you are not taking damage through the closed door, the cannon will target all of them.  You will need to run outside only occasionally to reload the cannon.  Sometimes the Werewolves would stack up in a single file at the door, this makes it difficult for the Cannon to target.  Moving around inside the house would spread them out and solve this problem. You can safespot werewolves over the rsrc17990 in the middle of the village, if you stand behind the bar in the pub in rsrc284, or across the two tables. There are 4 werewolves inside the bar. Note if you are safespotting; you will stop attacking when the human turns to the werewolf form. Werewolves can also be found permanently in their werewolf form in the rsrc467 (and rsrc690). These are slightly stronger than their Canifis variant, and are aligned with rsrc1220."

It has four forms, each of which must be fought consecutively, and each of which use Melee and have no drops. Its forms are a level 19 rsrc4956, a level 30 rsrc3308, a level 42 rsrc2370, and finally a level 53 rsrc5461, each of which are purple recolours of the respective monsters. Once you have defeated it, you may retrieve the rsrc2010. The experiment is described by rsrc2013 in her rsrc18170, where it appears to have been akin to a pet for her, as she is both angered and sorrowed at the loss of her precious \"Fritz\". It can be fought in the rsrc238 after the quest is complete. On both the normal and hard mode difficulty in the Nightmare Zone, the Experiment uses an ability that reduces combat stats, therefore, rsrc18171 are recommended.  Each of the Experiments' forms are numbered in its respective forms. When it's a spider, it is called \"Experiment (second form)\". When it's a bear, it's called \"Experiment (third form)\". When it's a wolf, it's final form, it is called \"Experiment (fourth form)\". This doesn't apply to its skavid form however, it's simply referred to as \"Experiment\". While the quest is active, players can take on the Experiment as many times as they wish. They simply have to leave and re-enter the shed and it will re-appear."

Its rsrc507 attack is a powerful slash from its claws that hits up to 28 rsrc65. The Yt-MejKot also has the ability to heal up to 10 of both its own hitpoints and those of any other monsters around it once the targets drops below half health. These are large monsters and are easily blocked by other monsters or the rocks in the cave. Yt-MejKots appear to only heal themselves whilst below half health, so it is very likely they will not heal at all if you are rsrc78 them from a rsrc15023. Yt-MejKots are a good source for healing hitpoints if the player has rsrc1127 equipment, due to the fact they recover their life points using their ability. Yt-MejKot, in the Tzhaar language, could be translated as \"Cold-Mage-Protect\" or \"Dead-Priest-Save\". \"Yt\" in TzHaar is cold, freeze, or dead. Yt-MejKot looks like a lizard, and lizards are cold blooded. \"Mej\" means priest or mage. In this case, it's probably a priest as the old examine text is \"Holy Reptile...\". \"Kot\" means save or protect. Yt-MejKot heal themselves and other nearby Fight Caves creatures, so they are protecting and saving them. They seem to heal themselves every 2 attacks they use, but this tends to occur only when meleeing them or standing very close to them."

    "article-text": "Zamorak wizards appear when doing rsrc655 rsrc4546, in the rsrc464. They call \"Die, human!\" upon appearing. Above level 20 Wilderness, you will lose your clue scroll (or rsrc18176!), and it will disappear, if it is not among your protected items. Similar to other untradeable items, they are meant to turn into coins; however, as they have a value of zero, they simply disappear. When doing a hard clue involving a Zamorak wizard encounter, this is easy to avoid, as you only need 3 items: a weapon (slashing rsrc18177), the clue scroll, and spade. If you bring more than 3/rsrc5519 items and are attacked by a PKer, you should quickly drop items that you don't care about compared to the clue scroll (such as the spade). With 70+ rsrc64 and a 1-dose rsrc1032, using four special attacks from the rsrc278 and relevant prayers should kill them almost every time, and if not they can be easily finished. Zamorak wizards are substantially weaker than rsrc4508. Zamorak wizards are not poisonous, have low health, low defence (except against rsrc59), and attack exclusively with Magic (using rsrc837). As such, activating rsrc5495 completely negates their damage. Since they have very little rsrc30, rsrc507 and rsrc78 are both effective in dispatching them. If you use Ranged, it is advisable to use a rsrc794 or rsrc1695 as they require no carried ammunition that would protect over the clue scroll. Magic, even a rsrc5180, is not advised as they are resistant due to their high Magic level. "

Their name is a portmanteau of 'zombie ogre'. Zogres are almost immune to normal weapons (you will hit just as often, but damage is reduced by 80%, rsrc498 of any kind recommended to strike from distance), but rsrc4811 are effective against them, as is the rsrc825 spell (damage is halved, for a maximum of 8). Also, rsrc296 works full power, so rsrc18179 weapons might be good against them. They can also infect you with rsrc7108, but you may counteract this with rsrc323 or rsrc6766, which may be bought from rsrc324 outside Jiggig for 200 rsrc321 (Relicym's balm only), or made using rsrc771. An rsrc7106 will protect you as well, but it will just hold the damage away. After the disease has come to 3 points of damage a time, the bracelet is gone.  The Zogres playing the drums can be attacked but only with rsrc78 or rsrc59. You will also need to telegrab their items, should you wish to pick them up. The colour of the drums that the Zogres play is slightly lighter than that of the other drums."

As it is undead, it is affected by the rsrc1086 and rsrc825. The zombie can be rsrc16428 using a skeleton found on the eastern side in the middle northern part of the room. Before the rsrc15919 update in rsrc75, the zombie used to appear randomly when burying rsrc2071. On appearance, it would say \"Brainsssss!\". As with similar guardian random events, the zombie's rsrc173 and stats scaled with the player's combat level, as well as only being attackable by the targeted player. These zombies were somewhat rare, as rsrc15921 players rarely buried bones in high enough quantities to activate this random event. Also, rsrc81 had two other random events that could occur while training it: rsrc18180 and rsrc16333. Zombies would not appear if training Prayer via the rsrc1937 or a rsrc1941. In addition to the drops above, this monster also has access to the rsrc550.  The zombie takes a minute to rsrc17235."

During the fight, Vorkath may freeze the player, and summon a Zombified Spawn. The spawn makes its way towards the player, and upon contact, will explode and deal up to 60 damage (30 during rsrc230), but will unfreeze the player. Since this spawn deals a lot of damage, it is recommended to cast rsrc825 on the spawn, as it instantly kills it, unless it ends in a splash. Killing the spawn will also free the player from the bind. Be sure to click elsewhere when you are frozen, as you will continue to attack Vorkath, which can delay your Crumble Undead spell and allow the spawn to damage you. Vorkath is immune to all forms of damage until the player unfreezes. If Vorkath dies the exact moment that you are frozen, the spawn will not die and continue to follow you. You can however, walk away from it. After a few seconds, it will die without exploding or having to be hit. Note that if the explosion occurs, it will deal damage based on how much hitpoints the Spawn had left upon explosion; because of this, a risky but alternative method to killing Vorkath is to bring rsrc18185 and take advantage of rsrc1128, while manually killing the Spawn with either a rsrc18186 or rsrc1361, since even if the player fails to kill the spawn, it will usually be damaged enough to make the explosion damage negligible.

    "article-text": "Normal Magma Tanzanite                                               Zulrah is a level 725 snake rsrc1708 that was released on 8 January rsrc240. It is a solo-only boss, meaning players cannot fight this boss in teams. Players can only attack with rsrc78 or rsrc59; though Zulrah can be reached with a Halberd, it is immune to melee attacks. Although completion of rsrc495 is not required to fight Zulrah, players must have completed the rsrc15898 to the point of reaching rsrc4557 (completion of Regicide is required for the teleport). There is also a rsrc16021 teleport, code BJS, west of rsrc2098 that is unusable without completion of Regicide. In addition, a stepping stone must be crossed to reach Zul-Andra, requiring 76 rsrc505 to use (can be boosted). Before the player can fight Zulrah, they must speak with rsrc8402 first and offer themselves as the sacrifice in place of the rsrc12256, as Zul-Gwenwynig will prevent the player from boarding the boat until Zul-Harcinqa allows you to be the sacrifice. Should a player die during their battle with Zulrah, they can retrieve their items by speaking to rsrc7058. However, if you die anywhere unsafe a second time without retrieving your items, all items from your first death will be lost completely. It is unknown when or how Zulrah arrived at the rsrc2249, but it is known to have adapted to the toxic waste surrounding it and eventually becoming the only creature able to live in the wastes. Zulrah's gender is ambiguous; the rsrc8402 refers to it as a male, while the examine text of Zulrah's rsrc7234 refers to it as a female. Sometime during the rsrc2390, rsrc8402's mother, Harcinqa, her daughter, and rsrc8400, her son, visited the Poison Waste. On 5th Bennath, group of men, rsrc8399, rsrc8401, rsrc18187, and several others, attempted to escape the elven clans by running south to the rsrc2249. With no food to eat, they attempted to fish for rsrc747 in the swamp, to no avail. With no luck on catching food, they decide to camp out with the gnomes. Two days after, Zulrah appeared during the night and ate five of Ohn's men before the group could get to their senses. The next day after that, Harcinqa's mother attracted Zulrah's attention with a giant campfire, and held out her son, Rentos, which it devoured immediately. The gnome woman bargained a deal with Zulrah, promising to send it sacrifices in return for food and worshipping it as a god. Zulrah agreed to the terms, and the next day, began sending eels to the group to eat. As a result, Zulrah is worshipped as a god and it is sent sacrifices daily, and in return, allows the village of Zul-Andra to stand and sends eels daily to the villagers. Zulrah is located in a shrine east of rsrc2098, which is accessed by boarding the sacrificial boat. The area is rsrc18188, and the player goes alone, meaning that Zulrah cannot be killed in teams. Upon entering the shrine, Zulrah will appear. The only way to escape from the shrine is by either teleporting out, or killing/dying to Zulrah. Players can spectate a fight using a telescope located on an island north of Zul-Andra, which is accessed by using the rsrc16021 code DLR. When a player defeats Zulrah, the drops will be received under the player, much like rsrc649. A rsrc10490 scroll will also be dropped around the player, which can be used to bring the player back to Zul-Andra. Zulrah uses rsrc1342, a stronger form of rsrc296 and starts off at 6 damage. Unlike poison which decreases over time, venom increases by 2 every time it hits. If not cured, the damage will continue to increase, eventually reaching a cap of 20. Venom can be cured instantly by drinking any rsrc1049 potion, or by two doses of any rsrc1037 potion. One dose of an antipoison will reduce it to regular poison. Wearing a rsrc2451 will prevent the player from becoming envenomed. Zulrah has different attacks depending on the colour it is. Zulrah changes forms by diving into the swamp and then reappearing somewhere in the arena (either in the middle or just outside the middle area, in a certain order depending on the first spawn after the rsrc78-rsrc507-rsrc59 attacks). Once Zulrah is defeated, a scroll is dropped on the ground near a players loot - upon reading the scroll, the player is teleported back to rsrc2098. Players cannot pick up this scroll. To fight Zulrah again after defeating it, a player must leave the shrine and return via the boat. When fighting Zulrah's green form, it is recommended to activate rsrc3014. When fighting Zulrah's blue form, rsrc5495 should be activated. However, there are two other green forms, one that will switch between rsrc59 and rsrc78 attacks towards the end of each attack pattern, so for this one, you must rsrc18189 each attack. Be aware in this stage, you may also be attacked by the rsrc18190 and can easily be combo'd out. The other green form can appear if the player takes too long on a pattern, and it will switch between Ranged and Magic attacks randomly like the blue one. The fight begins with the player in front of Zulrah in its green form. Avoid the toxic fumes that it creates as it fires them around the area. After a short time, it will immediately switch to a different form and begin using abilities and attacks from that form. During the turquoise form, it can use both toxic fumes and white orbs, which will summon a rsrc13030. Although snakelings have 1 rsrc16130, they can hit very hard against the player, so a rsrc1129 or a charged rsrc2466 is recommended to kill them off if needed. The areas that Zulrah launches white orbs will not have any toxic fumes during that phase, so stand in those areas when needed. When Zulrah is crimson, it will stare at the player before attacking that area. If they are not two spaces away from it, they will take rsrc507 damage and also be rsrc3080, which can leave the player in a dangerous state if their Hitpoints are low and there are nearby fumes. During his light green form, rsrc17950 can be helpful, and eat when needed, as both Magic and Ranged attacks will be used against the player. Zulrah and the snakelings can envenom the player very frequently even through protection prayers. However, the toxic clouds cannot inflict venom, nor can they be protected against. It is recommended to use rsrc1472 after becoming envenomed to maximise their effectiveness. It is recommended to use long-ranged attacks to avoid the venom clouds if Zulrah is in the way of them. Upon rsrc2672 at Zulrah, your items will be held by the rsrc7058 whom you talked to at the boat. Some specific anomalies occur with some specific items. This information may be useful to rsrc18191. The following items are destroyed forever and cannot be retrieved The following items are kept, but not in the state they were lost The following items are kept, along with their contents In addition to the 100% drop, the player will also have two rolls on Zulrah's drop table. There is a 1 in 256 chance of hitting the unique drop table per roll, meaning there's 1 in 128 chance per kill to receive any item from this table, as Zulrah gives two rolls per kill. Below lists the effective drop rates per kill of any specific item, which takes into account the fact that there are 4 different items in this drop table. In addition to the drops above, this monster  has a 1/32 chance to access the standard rsrc550. Prior to Zulrah's release, a poll was held to decide the name of the solo snake boss. The other entries, in order of popularity, were Ka'nes, Baloki, Attor, Dyzurah, and Duserpes. Zulrah's drop table originally had more items in greater quantities, such as rsrc3795, rsrc2718, rsrc1344, etc. Due to player complaints about the overall profitability and falling prices of certain items, the drop table was revised in rsrc18192 two weeks after release. Zulrah formerly uncommonly dropped two noted rsrc4577 as part of his drop table. This was replaced by access to the rsrc550 instead. The drop table once was again revised in rsrc16250 on 25 May rsrc125, decreasing the profitability of Zulrah by roughly 30%.

The drop table once was again revised in rsrc16250 on 25 May rsrc125, decreasing the profitability of Zulrah by roughly 30%. Upon release, Zulrah's green form had a high rsrc59 defence and the same rsrc78 rsrc30 as the other forms, making magic an unviable method of defeating it. This was changed in rsrc18192 two weeks later so that it is more resistant to ranged attacks, and less resistant to magical attacks. The same update brought two new rotations to Zulrah's encounter, as only two existed at the time. The same update brought two new rotations to Zulrah's encounter, as only two existed at the time. Zulrah's history is similar to that of rsrc18193 in rsrc16012 (in rsrc18194's world); both are worshipped as gods (although Zulrah is not a god itself) and are given sacrifices to please them."

Zygomites, referred to as Mutated Zygomites by the rsrc1956, are rsrc597 that appear as Fungi until provoked (Pick Fungi) that require level 57 rsrc285 to damage. They resemble giant mushrooms, and are only found in rsrc3820, near the rsrc4898 (level 86), or near the furnace (level 74). Players must use rsrc6316 on Zygomites to kill them. The Fungicide spray must be reloaded every ten kills. The reloads, rsrc6315, can be bought from the slayer master or obtained as a rsrc273 from Zygomites. Players cannot sell the spray or reloads back to the slayer master afterwards, so only buy what is needed. Players who have been given a Mutated Zygomite rsrc3482 can choose to kill rsrc4092 as an alternative for the task. Zygomites mostly use rsrc9243 headbutt which can hit substantial amounts, but they occasionally use more powerful rsrc10718 attacks by shooting spores. rsrc3050 is strongly recommended while fighting them, as the high Magic defence will reduce the chance of them hitting you.
